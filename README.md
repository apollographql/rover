[![GitHub Release Downloads](https://shields.io/github/downloads/apollographql/rover/total.svg)](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/releases/latest)

This is the home of Rover, the new CLI for Apollo's suite of GraphQL developer productivity tools.

### Note

This `README` contains just enough info to get you started with Rover. Our [docs](https://go.apollo.dev/r/docs) contain more detailed information that should be your primary reference for all things Rover.

## Usage

A few useful Rover commands to interact with your graphs:

1. Fetch a graph from a federated remote endpoint.

```bash
rover graph fetch test@cats
```

1. Validate recent changes made to your local graph with `rover graph check`.

```bash
rover graph check --schema=./path-to-valid-sdl test@cats
```

1. Publish your local graph to Apollo Studio.

```bash
rover graph publish --schema ./path-to-valid-schema test@cats
```

## Command-line options

```console

          Commands for working with templates
  readme
          Readme commands
  subgraph
          Subgraph schema commands

  update
          Commands related to updating rover
  persisted-queries
          Commands for persisted queries [aliases: pq]
  explain
          Explain error codes
  help
          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -l, --log <LOG_LEVEL>
          Specify Rover's log level

      --format <FORMAT_KIND>
          Specify Rover's format type
          
          [possible values: plain, json]

  -o, --output <OUTPUT_FILE>
          Specify a file to write Rover's output to

      --insecure-accept-invalid-certs
          Accept invalid certificates when performing HTTPS requests.
          
          You should think very carefully before using this flag.
          
          If invalid certificates are trusted, any certificate for any site will be trusted for use. This includes expired certificates. This introduces significant vulnerabilities, and should only be used as a last resort.

      --insecure-accept-invalid-hostnames
          Accept invalid hostnames when performing HTTPS requests.
          
          You should think very carefully before using this flag.
          
          If hostname verification is not used, any valid certificate for any site will be trusted for use from any other. This introduces a significant vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks.

      --client-timeout <CLIENT_TIMEOUT>
          Configure the timeout length (in seconds) when performing HTTP(S) requests
          
          [default: 30]

      --skip-update-check
          Skip checking for newer versions of rover

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version

Read the getting started guide by running:

    $ rover docs open start

To begin working with Rover and to authenticate with Apollo Studio,
run the following command:

    $ rover config auth

This will prompt you for an API Key that can be generated in Apollo Studio.

The most common commands from there are:

    - rover graph fetch: Fetch a graph schema from the Apollo graph registry
    - rover graph check: Check for breaking changes in a local graph schema against a graph schema in the Apollo graph
registry
    - rover graph publish: Publish an updated graph schema to the Apollo graph registry

You can open the full documentation for Rover by running:

    $ rover docs open
```

This repo is organized as a [`cargo` workspace], containing several related projects:

- `rover`: Apollo's suite of GraphQL developer productivity tools
- [`houston`]: utilities for configuring Rover
- [`robot-panic`]: a fork of [`rust-cli/human-panic`] adjusted for Rover
- [`rover-client`]: an HTTP client for making GraphQL requests for Rover
- [`sputnik`]: a crate to aid in collection of anonymous data for Rust CLIs
- [`timber`]: Rover's logging formatter

## Installation Methods

#### Linux and MacOS `curl | sh` installer

To install the latest release of Rover:

```bash
curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/latest | sh
```

To install a specific version of Rover (note the `v` prefixing the version number):

> Note: If you're installing Rover in a CI environment, it's best to target a specific version rather than using the latest URL, since future major breaking changes could affect CI workflows otherwise.

```bash
curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/v0.10.0 | sh
```

You will need `curl` installed on your system to run the above installation commands. You can get the latest version from [the curl downloads page](https://curl.se/download.html).

> Note: `rover supergraph compose` is currently not available for Alpine Linux. You may track the progress for supporting this command on Alpine in [this issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/537).

#### Windows PowerShell installer

```bash
iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/latest' | iex
```

To install a specific version of Rover (note the `v` prefixing the version number):

> Note: If you're installing Rover in a CI environment, it's best to target a specific version rather than using the latest URL, since future major breaking changes could affect CI workflows otherwise.

```bash
iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/v0.10.0' | iex
```

#### npm installer

Rover is distributed on npm for easy integration with your JavaScript projects.

##### devDependency install

If you'd like to install `rover` as a `devDependency` in your JavaScript project, you can run `npm i --save-dev @apollo/rover`. You can then call `rover` directly in your `package.json` [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts), or you can run `npx rover` in your project directory to execute commands.

##### Manual download and install

If you'd like to call `rover` from any directory on your machine, you can run `npm i -g @apollo/rover`.

Note: Unfortunately if you've installed `npm` without a version manager such as `nvm`, you may have trouble with global installs. If you encounter an `EACCES` permission-related error while trying to install globally, DO NOT run the install command with `sudo`. [This support page](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) has information that should help to resolve this issue.

#### Without curl

You can also [download the binary for your operating system](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/releases) and manually add its location to your `PATH`.

##### Unsupported architectures

If you don't see your CPU architecture supported as part of our release pipeline, you can build from source with [`cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo). Clone this repo, and run `cargo xtask dist --version v0.1.3`. This will compile a released version of Rover for you, and place the binary in your `target` directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/rover
cargo xtask dist --version v0.1.3
```

From here you can either place the binary in your `PATH` manually, or run `./target/release/{optional_target}/rover install`.
