This is the home of Rover, the new CLI for Apollo's suite of GraphQL developer productivity tools.

### Note

This `README` contains just enough info to get you started with Rover. Our [docs](https://go.apollo.dev/r/docs) contain more detailed information that should be your primary reference for all things Rover.

## Usage

A few useful Rover commands to interact with your graphs:

1. Fetch a graph from a federated remote endpoint.

```bash
rover graph fetch test@cats
```

1. Validate recent changes made to your local graph with `rover graph check`.

```bash
rover graph check --schema=./path-to-valid-sdl test@cats
```

1. Publish your local graph to Apollo Studio.

```bash
rover graph publish --schema ./path-to-valid-schema test@cats
```

## Command-line options

```console
Rover 0.6.0

Rover - Your Graph Companion
Read the getting started guide by running:

    $ rover docs open start

To begin working with Rover and to authenticate with Apollo Studio,
run the following command:

    $ rover config auth

This will prompt you for an API Key that can be generated in Apollo Studio.

The most common commands from there are:

    - rover graph fetch: Fetch a graph schema from the Apollo graph registry
    - rover graph check: Check for breaking changes in a local graph schema against a graph schema in the Apollo graph
registry
    - rover graph publish: Publish an updated graph schema to the Apollo graph registry

You can open the full documentation for Rover by running:

    $ rover docs open

This repo is organized as a [`cargo` workspace], containing several related projects:

- `rover`: Apollo's suite of GraphQL developer productivity tools
- [`houston`]: utilities for configuring Rover
- [`robot-panic`]: a fork of [`rust-cli/human-panic`] adjusted for Rover
- [`rover-client`]: an HTTP client for making GraphQL requests for Rover
- [`sputnik`]: a crate to aid in collection of anonymous data for Rust CLIs
- [`timber`]: Rover's logging formatter

## Installation Methods

#### Linux and MacOS `curl | sh` installer

To install the latest release of Rover:

```bash
curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/latest | sh
```

To install a specific version of Rover (note the `v` prefixing the version number):

> Note: If you're installing Rover in a CI environment, it's best to target a specific version rather than using the latest URL, since future major breaking changes could affect CI workflows otherwise.

```bash
curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/v0.6.0 | sh
```

You will need `curl` installed on your system to run the above installation commands. You can get the latest version from [the curl downloads page](https://curl.se/download.html).

> Note: `rover supergraph compose` is currently not available for Alpine Linux. You may track the progress for supporting this command on Alpine in [this issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/537).

#### Windows PowerShell installer

```bash
iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/latest' | iex
```

To install a specific version of Rover (note the `v` prefixing the version number):

> Note: If you're installing Rover in a CI environment, it's best to target a specific version rather than using the latest URL, since future major breaking changes could affect CI workflows otherwise.

```bash
iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/v0.6.0' | iex
```

#### npm installer

Rover is distributed on npm for easy integration with your JavaScript projects.

##### devDependency install

If you'd like to install `rover` as a `devDependency` in your JavaScript project, you can run `npm i --save-dev @apollo/rover`. You can then call `rover` directly in your `package.json` [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts), or you can run `npx rover` in your project directory to execute commands.

##### Manual download and install

If you'd like to call `rover` from any directory on your machine, you can run `npm i -g @apollo/rover`.

Note: Unfortunately if you've installed `npm` without a version manager such as `nvm`, you may have trouble with global installs. If you encounter an `EACCES` permission-related error while trying to install globally, DO NOT run the install command with `sudo`. [This support page](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) has information that should help to resolve this issue.

#### Without curl

You can also [download the binary for your operating system](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/releases) and manually add its location to your `PATH`.

##### Unsupported architectures

If you don't see your CPU architecture supported as part of our release pipeline, you can build from source with [`cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo). Clone this repo, and run `cargo xtask dist --version v0.1.3`. This will compile a released version of Rover for you, and place the binary in your `target` directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/rover
cargo xtask dist --version v0.1.3
```

From here you can either place the binary in your `PATH` manually, or run `./target/release/{optional_target}/rover install`.
