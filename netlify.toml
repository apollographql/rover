  # This next "ignore" setting is telling Netlify build servers to run the
  # actual "false" shell built-in or /bin/false.  It must be quoted as "false"
  # so it's not interpreted as a boolean literal.  The intention is to not ever
  # ignore changes and short-circuit (saving build time, in theory) since it
  # it cannot seem to actually determine accurately whether or not we have
  # changes based on the way we build our docs.  Put another way, this just
  # always kicks off the build.
