This error occurs when you propose a subgraph schema that could not be composed.

There are many reasons why you may run into composition errors. This error should include information about _why_ the proposed subgraph schema could not be composed. Error code references can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/errors/).

Some composition errors are part of normal workflows. For instance, you may need to publish a subgraph that does not compose if you are trying to [migrate an entity or field](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/#migrating-entities-and-fields-advanced).
