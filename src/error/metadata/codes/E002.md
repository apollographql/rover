This error occurs when trying to build headers for requests, and a header name is invalid.

Examples of an invalid header name include header names with included spaces and non-ascii characters in the name.

To resolve, check your headings for any unusual characters.

If this error occurs on a command where you aren't providing headers, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/new?body=Error%20E002%0A%0ADescribe%20your%20issue%20or%20question%20here&labels=triage) and let us know!
