This error occurs when an API key isn't recognized by the graph registry. Your key may have been disabled, changed, or saved improperly.

Try running `rover config whoami` to debug API key issues. 

Check the length of the key shown in the response of this command and make sure it's what you expect. Sometimes double-pasting the key when running `auth` can happen.
