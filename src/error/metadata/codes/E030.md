This error occurs when an operation check fails. This means that you proposed a schema that would break operations in use by existing clients. You can configure this behavior in the Checks -> Configuration view in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/), and you can read more about client checks [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema-checks/).
