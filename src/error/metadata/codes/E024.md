This error occurs when Rover tries to load a configuration profile that has been modified with invalid TOML.

If you modified a configuration file by hand, double check to make sure your formatting is appropriate.

If you did not intentionally modify a configuration profile, you may need to delete the profile and re-create it with `rover config delete --profile <NAME>` and `rover config auth --profile <NAME>`.

If this error persists, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/new?body=Error%20E025%0A%0ADescribe%20your%20issue%20or%20question%20here&labels=triage) and let us know.
