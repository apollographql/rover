This error occurs when working with federated graphs and the subgraph `--name` provided doesn't exist as a valid subgraph.

To find a list of subgraphs already published to a graph, open the graph in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com) or run `rover subgraph list <GRAPH_ID>@<VARIANT>`.
