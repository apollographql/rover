This occurs when an API key is not in the format expected.

Registry API keys are in one of the following formats:

`user:my-username:secretkey`
`service:graph-id:secretkey`

If you're getting this error, it's because the key couldn't be parsed properly based on these formats. Run `rover config whoami` to make sure your key looks like you expect it to. 

The middle of the key is masked for security, but you should be able to see the `user` or `serv` at the beginning of the key, and the last few characters of the key, along with its length.
