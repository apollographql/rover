This error occurs when trying to setup a configuration profile, and Rover is unable to create the directory to store this information in. 

This is usually a permissions issue. If your system's default configuration directory is inaccessible, you can use the `APOLLO_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable to choose a different directory. See Rover's [configuring docs](https://go.apollo.dev/r/configuring) for more info.
