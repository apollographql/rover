This error occurs when the expected JSON response from a GraphQL endpoint can't be deserialized.

This is most likely caused by an invalid endpoint or headers, causing the server to return something that is not JSON (like an HTML error page).

Try running the command again with `--log trace` to see what the GraphQL endpoint is responding with.

If this error occurs on a command interacting with the Apollo Registry, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/new?body=Error%20E001%0A%0ADescribe%20your%20issue%20or%20question%20here&labels=triage) and let us know!
