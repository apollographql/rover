This error occurs when using a `contract` command on a non-contract variant.

The variant you're trying to run this operation on isn't a contract variant. Double check the specified `graph@variant` combination is valid and a contract variant on the [Studio variant settings page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/contracts/#editing-a-contract).
