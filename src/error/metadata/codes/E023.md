This error occurs when trying to save or load a configuration profile using a file path that is not valid UTF-8.

This is likely due to an invalid path in your `APOLLO_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable. 

Check your environment variable or use `--log trace` for more information about the path that Rover is trying to use.
