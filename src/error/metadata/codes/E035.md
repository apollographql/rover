This error occurs on Windows when a configuration profile has a corrupted API key. Versions of Rover before v0.8.2 used to create corrupted API keys with the `rover config auth` command.

You will need to recreate the configuration profile in order to proceed. See Rover's [configuring docs](https://go.apollo.dev/r/configuring) for more info.
