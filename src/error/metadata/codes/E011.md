This error occurs when an introspection response from a GraphQL endpoint can't be parsed properly.

Verify your endpoint is correct, and use `--log trace` to make sure the response from the server is the expected JSON response. If you're still seeing this error with the correct introspection response from the server, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/new?body=Error%20E012%0A%0ADescribe%20your%20issue%20or%20question%20here&labels=triage) and let us know!
