This error occurs when trying to setup a configuration profile, and Rover is unable to determine your system's defauly configuration directory. 

You can use the `APOLLO_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable to tell Rover where to save and find configuration info. See Rover's [configuring docs](https://go.apollo.dev/r/configuring) for more info.
