This error occurs when Rover made an HTTP request and it timed out.

The client timeout that Rover sets is configurable. You can [increase Rover's request timeout](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/configuring/#bypass-tlsssl-validation), but it's also possible that you've made a request for too much data from the Studio API, or that the Studio API is experiencing degraded performance. You can check for known performance issues on our [status page](https://status.apollographql.com).
