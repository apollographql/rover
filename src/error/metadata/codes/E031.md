This error occurs when Rover made an HTTP(S) request and it timed out.

The client timeout that Rover sets is configurable. You can try increasing the number of seconds Rover will wait to timeout with the `--client-timeout` flag, but it's also possible that you've made a request for too much data from the Studio API, or that the Studio API is experiencing degraded performance. You can check for the latter at our [status page](https://status.apollographql.com).
