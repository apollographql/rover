This error occurs when an endpoint returns an HTTP status between 400-599.

These errors are most common with a misuse of an endpoint. If you are running `introspection` commands or fetching from an endpoint for composition, it's likely you misused headers or specified the wrong url. 

Check your urls, headers, and if needed, run the command again with `--log trace` to see specific details about the request/response.
