This error can occur because of graph lookup issues or authentication failures.

Graphs you don't have permission to will always error as unavailable for security purposes. Check your API keys with `rover config whoami` and make sure your graph IDs are properly spelled.

If applicable, check with your graph admin to make sure permissions and keys haven't changed.
