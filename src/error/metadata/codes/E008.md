This error occurs when an invalid variant is specified for a command.

Double check your spelling or open the graph in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com) to verify that the variant you're trying to use is valid.

If you didn't pass a variant in the format `graph@variant`, then the default variant, `current` is used. If you encounter this error without providing a variant, it likely means the `current` variant does not exist.
