This error occurs when a schema file has lint rule violations.

The schema you're linting has violated some of the rules configured for your graph. Fix the errors and re-run the lint command to verify the violations have been addressed. See [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/schema-linter/) for more information about schema linting.
