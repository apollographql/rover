This error occurs when a supergraph configuration file failed to resolve all of the subgraph schemas.

This error should include information about _why_ the schemas could not be resolved, and include the name of the subgraph that could not be resolved. See [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/supergraphs#yaml-configuration-file) for more information on the configuration format.
