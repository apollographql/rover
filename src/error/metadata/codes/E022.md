This error occurs when trying to use a configuration profile that can't be found.

This is most likely the result of a typo when running a command with the `--profile` option or saving a new profile. 

Run `apollo config list` to see a full list of available configuration profiles or `apollo config auth` to set up a new one. 

Check out Rover's [configuration docs](https://go.apollo.dev/r/configuring) for more on how to set up and use Rover.
