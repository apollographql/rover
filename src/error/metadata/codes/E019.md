This error occurs when trying to clear all of Rover's local config, but none is found.

This may be the result of running the `rover config clear` command multiple times, or an update to your `APOLLO_CONFIG_HOME` variable.

See Rover's [configuration docs](https://go.apollo.dev/r/configuring) for more on how to manage Rover's configuration.
