This error occurs when a downstream check task fails. This means that you proposed a schema for your source variant that causes checks to fail in blocking downstream variants. You can configure which downstream variants are blocking in the Checks -> Configuration view in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/), and you can read more about client checks [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema-checks/).
