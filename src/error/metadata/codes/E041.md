This error occurs when a new subgraph fails to publish due to a missing `--routing-url`.

The subgraph you're trying to publish has never been published before, meaning it would be unreachable without specifying a `--routing-url`. In subsequent publishes, the `--routing-url` is optional and will default to the previous value.
