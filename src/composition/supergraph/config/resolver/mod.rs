//! This module provides an object that can either produce a [`LazilyResolvedsupergraphConfig`] or a
//! [`FullyResolvedSupergraphConfig`] and uses the typestate pattern to enforce the order
//! in which certain steps must happen.
//!
//! The process that is outlined by this pattern is the following:
//!   1. Load remote subgraphs (if a [`GraphRef`] is provided)
//!   2. Load subgraphs from local config (if a supergraph config file is provided)
//!   3. Resolve subgraphs into one of: [`LazilyResolvedsupergraphConfig`] or [`FullyResolvedSupergraphConfig`]
//!      a. [`LazilyResolvedsupergraphConfig`] is used to spin up a [`SubgraphWatchers`] object, which
//!         provides SDL updates as subgraphs change
//!      b. [`FullyResolvedSupergraphConfig`] is used to produce a composition result
//!         from [`SupergraphBinary`]. This must be written to a file first, using the format defined
//!         by [`SupergraphConfig`]
