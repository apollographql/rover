This is the home of Rover, the new CLI for Apollo's suite of GraphQL developer productivity tools.

## Usage

A few useful Rover comamnds to interact with your graphs.

1. Validate recent changes made to your local graph with `rover graph check`.

```bash
rover graph check --schema=./path-to-valid-sdl test@cats
```

2. Push your local graph to Apollo Studio.

```bash
rover graph push --schema ./path-to-valid-schema test@cats
```

3. Fetch a graph from a federated remote endpoint.

```bash
rover subgraph fetch --name=pets test@cats
```
