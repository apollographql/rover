# This is just a little script that can be downloaded from the internet to
# install rover-fed2. You must first install Rover and have it in your PATH
# in order to use this script. If you have installed via npm, you will need to uninstall
# and reinstall with the iwr | iex installer.

# This script first downloads Rover, which in turn downloads the rover-fed2 tarball
# by invoking `rover install --plugin rover-fed2 $Args`. This means that you can pass
# arguments to this shell script and they will be passed along to the installer.

# Example to bypass binary overwrite [y/N] prompt
# iwr https://rover.apollo.dev/plugins/rover-fed2/win/latest | iex --force

# Example to Accept the terms and conditions in the elv2 license
# iwr https://rover.apollo.dev/plugins/rover-fed2/win/latest | iex --elv2-license accept
