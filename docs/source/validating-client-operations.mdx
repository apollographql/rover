title: Validating Client Operations
subtitle: Confirm that all client operations are supported by your schema
---

You can confirm that all of the GraphQL operations defined in your client application are valid against the types, fields, and arguments in your graph's [published schema](./publication). To do so, you use the `apollo client:check` command of the [Apollo CLI](/rover/apollo-cli/):

```
$ apollo client:check

  ✔ Loading Apollo Project
  ✔ Checking client compatibility with service

GetTeamGrid: src/components/TeamGrid.jsx:4

    FAILURE    Field "league" must not have a selection since type "SportsLeague" has no subfields.

4 total operations validated
1 failure
```

You run this command from your client application's root. It recursively scans your project for the following:

- GraphQL operations wrapped in the `gql` tag
- [Client-side schema extensions](/react/local-state/client-side-schema/) wrapped in the `gql` tag

By combining your registered graph's schema with your client-side schema extensions, the `apollo client:check` command can confirm whether the shape of each defined operation conforms to the shape of your combined schema.

Make sure that your project [provides a graph API key](/devtools/cli/#provide-an-api-key) to the Apollo CLI. This both authenticates the CLI with Studio and specifies which graph's schema you're checking against.

## Checking against a particular variant

During development, your application might be executing GraphQL operations against a locally running server with a schema that differs somewhat from your production server's schema. Because schemas can differ, it's important to always check your operations against the current schema for a particular environment before you push client changes to that environment.

If you represent each of your server's environments with a separate [graph variant](../graphs/#variants) (recommended), you can check your operations against a particular variant's schema like so:

```
$ apollo client:check --variant=production
```

## Using with continuous integration

Your application can incorporate `client:check` into its continuous delivery pipeline to help ensure that new and modified operations are valid before they go live.

Here's a Circle CI configuration excerpt that incorporates the command:

```yaml {30} title="config.yml"
version: 2

jobs:
  # ...other jobs...

  # Define a separate job for each environment you validate against.
  check_against_staging:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:12

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run: npm install

      # CircleCI needs global installs to be sudo
      - run: sudo npm install --global apollo

      # This command authenticates using the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable.
      # Don't forget to provide your API key in it.
      - run: npx apollo client:check --variant=staging
```
