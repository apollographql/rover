There are a few ways to set up Rover to make sure it's working exactly how you'd like it to.

## Profiles

Rover uses configuration profiles to track certain global config values like api keys. These values are associated with a profile, and can be chosen at runtime with the `--profile` flag.

```
graph check my-company@prod --profile work
```

Profiles are useful for managing multiple user API keys, but if you don't need to switch profiles, the `default` profile is used when no `--profile` is passed.

To see all commands for viewing, editing, and deleting profiles, run the following in Rover:

```
rover config profile --help
```

## Authenticating with Apollo Studio

Most commands in Rover communicate with Apollo Studio and need an API key. To save an API key to a profile, do the following:

#### Local Development

This command will instruct you where to go in Apollo Studio to find an API key and prompt you to paste it into the command.

```
rover config profile auth
```

This command will save the key to the `default` profile unless you pass a `--profile` option to it.

#### CI/CD 

Since interactive commands don't work in CI/CD environments, you can alternatively use the `APOLLO_KEY` env variable to authenticate Apollo Studio.

It's best practice to use a `service:` key in CI environments, rather than a `user:` key. The difference in the two is that a service key is scoped to have permissions to access only a single graph, whereas user keys can be used to access any graph a user has access to.

## Anonymous Telemetry

By default, Apollo collects anonymous data about how Rover is being used. We don't collect any personally identifiable values (like keys, graph names, file paths, etc). 

If you would like to disable telemetry, you can set the `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` env variable.

For more info on how Apollo collects and uses this data, see [our privacy notice]().

## Logging

There are 5 possible levels of logging that can happen in Rover. These include `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`, ranging from the quietest logs to the most verbose logs. 

By default, only `error`, `warn`, and `info` messages are logged, but any command can be made verbose by changing the log level to either `debug` and `trace` using the `--log` or `-l` flag.

```
rover graph check my-graph@prod --schema ./schema.graphql --log debug
```

If logs are unhelpful or unclear, please leave the Rover team feedback in an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues)!
