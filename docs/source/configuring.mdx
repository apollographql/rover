There are a few ways to set up Rover to make sure it's working exactly how you'd like it to.

## Profiles

Rover uses configuration profiles to track certain global config values like api keys. These values are associated with a profile, and can be chosen at runtime.

```
graph check my-company@prod --profile work
```
