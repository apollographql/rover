## Rover

Rover is the newest CLI from [Apollo](https://apollographql.com). It is intended
to be the successor to the [Apollo CLI](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling).

- Rover is a CLI for Graph maintainers. It provides all the tools engineers need 
to manage the publishing and updating of a GraphQL API using Apollo Studio.
- Rover is _not_ a one-stop tool for all engineers using GraphQL. Client engineers
may not find much use from Rover at this time, since it doesn't include code
generation or client checks.

## Feedback

Rover is being actively developed, and we'd love to hear your feedback if you've
tried out Rover. 

Feedback we'd love to see is:

- Are Rover's features easy to discover?
- Are the concepts easy/difficult to understand
- How helpful are the error messages or logs? Could we add more detail to an
error?
- What features are we missing?

If you have some feedback, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues)!
