description: Understand what data Rover collects and how to opt out of data collection
---

Rover doesn't collect any personally identifiable information such as API keys, graph names, or file paths. 

By default, Rover collects some anonymous usage data to help us improve the tool. To opt out of data collection, set the `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable to `true` in each environment where you use Rover.

## Collected data

Unless you opt out, Rover reports the following data each time you run a command:

- The command that was run (excluding any identifiable arguments such as file-system paths or profile names)
- The version of `rover` that was executed
- A unique, anonymized **machine identifier**, which is the same for every command run on the same machine
- A unique, anonymized **session identifier**, which is different for every command
- The SHA-256 hash of the directory that `rover` was executed from
- The operating system `rover` was executed on
- The CPU architecture `rover` was executed on
- The CI system `rover` was executed on, if any
