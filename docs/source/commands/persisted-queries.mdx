import AuthNotice from '../../shared/auth-notice.mdx';

With [GraphOS Enterprise](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing), you can enhance a graph's security by maintaining a **persisted query list** (**PQL**) for your graph's self-hosted router. The [GraphOS Router](/router/) checks incoming requests against the PQL, and can be configured to reject operations that aren't registered in the list.

Registering operations to a PQL has two steps:

1. Generating persisted queries manifests (PQMs) using client-specific tooling
2. Publishing PQMs to the PQL using Rover

This article details the latter. For more information on PQM generation and other implementation steps, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries).

## Publishing a PQM

### `persisted-queries publish`

<AuthNotice />

You can use Rover to publish a PQM for any client to any [existing PQL](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries#1-pql-creation-and-linking). 

Run the `persisted-queries publish` command, like so:

```bash
rover persisted-queries publish my-graph@my-variant \
  --manifest ./persisted-query-manifest.json
```

- The `my-graph@my-variant` argument is the [`graph ref`](../conventions#graph-refs) of any variant the PQL is [linked to](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries#12-link-the-pql-to-variants).
    - Graph refs have the format `graph-id@variant-name`.
- Use the `--manifest` option to provide the path to the manifest you want to publish.

Instead of `my-graph@my-variant`, you can combine the `--graph-id` and `--list-id` options to specify the PQL you want to publish to:

```bash
rover persisted-queries publish \
  --graph-id my_graph --list-id dc4b4040-30fc-4bd1-94a3-5fc1c722acc9 \
  --manifest ./persisted-query-manifest.json
```

- Use `--graph-id` to provide the graph's ID
- Use `--list-id` to provide the PQL's UUID

**The `persisted-queries publish` command does the following:**

1. Publishes all operations in the provided manifest file to the PQL linked to the specified variant, or to the specified PQL.
    - Publishing a manifest to a PQL is additive. Any existing entries in the PQL remain.
    - You can use the `--for-client-name CLIENT-NAME` option to [associate all operations in the manifest with a given client name](/graphos/platform/security/persisted-queries#associating-operations-with-clients), or you can specify `clientName` on each operation in the JSON file.
    - If you publish an operation with the same `id` and `clientName` but different details from an existing entry in the PQL, the entire publish command fails with an error.

2. Updates any other variants that the PQL is applied to so that routers associated with those variants can fetch their updated PQL.

As with [generating manifests](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries#31-generate-persisted-query-manifests), it's best to execute this command in your CI/CD pipeline to publish new operations as part of your app release process. This command requires your API key to have the [**Graph Admin** or **Persisted Query Publisher** role](/graphos/org/members#graph-api-key-roles); the latter is a role specifically designed to work with this command without exposing unnecessary information about your graph to users of the API key.

#### Relay support

<MinVersionBadge version="v0.19.0">

The `rover persisted-queries` command supports publishing [persisted queries generated by the Relay compiler](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/persisted-queries/#local-persisted-queries).

1. Configure the Relay compiler to output a JSON operation manifest to a specified location according to [their documentation](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/persisted-queries/#local-persisted-queries).
1. Use the `persisted-queries publish` command to publish the manifest to Apollo GraphOS. The command usage is the same as when publishing Apollo-generated manifests, but you must include the `--manifest-format relay` argument:

```bash
rover persisted-queries publish my-graph@my-variant \
  --manifest ./persisted-queries.json \
  --manifest-format relay
```
