Rover enables you to manage <code>operator</code> and <code>subgraph</code> API keys for your GraphOS organization. These API key types are used to authenticate with GraphOS and determine permissions for accessing graphs, subgraphs, and other resources for your organization. You can manage your organization's API keys with the <code>rover api-keys</code> set of commands.

## Creating API keys

### `api-keys create`

The `api-keys create` command creates a new API key for your organization:

```
rover api-keys create <ORGANIZATION_ID> <TYPE> <NAME>
```

For subgraph keys, you can specify which subgraphs the key should have access to using a configuration file:

```
rover api-keys create <ORGANIZATION_ID> subgraph <NAME> --subgraph-config subgraph-config.yaml
```

The subgraph configuration file should be in YAML format:

```yaml
graph-id:
  variant-name:
    - subgraph-name-1
    - subgraph-name-2
```

You can also pipe the subgraph configuration from stdin:

```
cat subgraph-config.yaml | rover api-keys create <ORGANIZATION_ID> subgraph <NAME>
```

#### Key Types
The available key types are:
- `operator`: Full access to the organization
- `subgraph`: Limited access to specific subgraphs

## Listing API keys

### `api-keys list`

The `api-keys list` command lists all API keys for your organization:

```
rover api-keys list <ORGANIZATION_ID>
```

This command displays all API keys with their details, including creation date, expiration date (if any), ID, and name.

## Deleting API keys

### `api-keys delete`

The `api-keys delete` command deletes an existing API key:

```
rover api-keys delete <ORGANIZATION_ID> <ID>
```

This action can't be undone. Make sure you have the correct key ID before deleting.

## Renaming API keys

### `api-keys rename`

The `api-keys rename` command renames an existing API key:

```
rover api-keys rename <ORGANIZATION_ID> <ID> <NEW_NAME>
```

Use this command to organize and identify your API keys more easily.
