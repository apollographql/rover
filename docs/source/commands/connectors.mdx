Rover provides a set of commands for managing [Apollo Connectors](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/connectors) from the command line. They all begin with `rover connector`.

Connector related commands allow you to analyze API requests, generate schemas based on that analysis, and create automated tests for your connectors. There are other management capabilities provided by Rover as well. For full documentation, review the Apollo Connector documentation on [CLI tools for connectors](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/connectors/tooling/cli-tools).
