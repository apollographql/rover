Rover provides a set of `rover connector` commands for managing [Apollo Connectors](/graphos/connectors). These allow you to run and analyze API requests, generate schemas based on that analysis, and create automated tests for your connectors. 

For a complete reference, see the [CLI tools for connectors](/graphos/connectors/tooling/cli-tools).
