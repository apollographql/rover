The `rover install` command enables you to:

- re-install or upgrade the Rover binary
- install officially supported plugins that Rover uses for composition and local development

## Install Rover

When you run `rover install` without the `--plugin` option, it re-installs or upgrades the Rover binary. The same behavior is used by the `curl` [(Linux/macOS)](/rover/getting-started#linux--macos-installer) and PowerShell [(Windows)](/rover/getting-started#windows-powershell-installer) install scripts.

```bash
rover install
```

If Rover is already installed at the same location, you will be prompted to confirm overwriting. To overwrite without prompting (for example in CI), use `--force`:

```bash
rover install --force
```

To install Rover for the first time, [use the official installation methods](/rover/getting-started#installation-methods).

## Install plugins

Use `rover install --plugin <name>@<version>` to download and install an officially supported plugin. Plugins are installed alongside the Rover binary and are used by commands such as [rover dev](/rover/commands/dev) and supergraph composition.

### Supported plugins

| Plugin | Description | Version format | Example |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| `supergraph` | Federation supergraph composition binary | `latest`, `latest-2`, or exact `=X.Y.Z` | `supergraph@latest`, `supergraph@latest-2`, `supergraph@=2.8.0`  |
| `router` | Apollo Router (1.x) | `latest` or exact `vX.Y.Z` (1.0.0 ≤ version &lt; 2.0.0) |  `router@latest`, `router@v1.0.0` |
| `apollo-mcp-server` | Apollo MCP Server | `latest` or exact `vX.Y.Z` | `apollo-mcp-server@latest`, `apollo-mcp-server@v1.0.0` |

### Examples

Install the latest supergraph plugin for Federation 2:

```bash
rover install --plugin supergraph@latest-2
```

Install a pinned version of the Router:

```bash
rover install --plugin router@v1.0.0
```

Install the Apollo MCP Server (used with `rover dev` for MCP):

```bash
rover install --plugin apollo-mcp-server@latest
```

### Accept the ELv2 license

Some plugins require accepting the [ELv2 license](https://go.apollo.dev/elv2). You will see a prompt asking you to accept the license before continuing.

To accept the license without a follow-up prompt, use the `--elv2-license accept` flag. This is useful when using this command in a CI environment.

```bash
rover install --plugin supergraph@latest-2 --elv2-license accept
```

You can also set the environment variable `APOLLO_ELV2_LICENSE=accept` to accept the license.

```bash
export APOLLO_ELV2_LICENSE=accept
rover install --plugin router@latest
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `-f`, `--force` | Overwrite any existing binary or plugin without prompting for confirmation. |
| `--plugin <PLUGIN>` | Download and install an officially supported plugin. Value must be in the form `name@version` (e.g. `supergraph@latest-2`). |
| `--elv2-license <ELV2_LICENSE_ACCEPTED>` | Accept the ELv2 license without prompting. Expected value: `accept`. Can also be set via the `APOLLO_ELV2_LICENSE` environment variable. |

Other common Rover options (e.g. `--log`, `--format`, `--client-timeout`) also apply. Run `rover install --help` for the full list.
