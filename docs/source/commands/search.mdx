## Overview

The `rover search` command finds schema elements by keyword. Search matches against type names, field names, argument names, and descriptions. Each result includes a complete path from a Query or Mutation root, with all intermediate types.

## Usage

```bash
rover search <GRAPH_REF> <TERMS> [OPTIONS]
```

## Examples

### Basic search

```bash
rover search my-graph@my-variant "search terms"
```

Returns matching paths with all intermediate types expanded, so you have enough context to write a query from a single search result.

### Limiting results

```bash
rover search my-graph@my-variant "search terms" --limit 3
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-l, --limit <N>` | Maximum number of result paths (default: 5) |
| `--include-deprecated` | Include deprecated fields in results |
| `--sdl` | Output raw SDL instead of structured description |
| `--compact` | Output token-efficient compact notation |
| `--no-cache` | Skip the local schema cache |
| `--profile <NAME>` | Name of configuration profile to use |

## Output formats

By default, `rover search` outputs human-readable results with full paths from Query/Mutation roots. Three alternatives are available:

- **`--sdl`**: Raw SDL for matched types
- **`--compact`**: Token-efficient notation
- **`--format json`** (global): Structured JSON output

When output is piped (stdout is not a TTY), compact format is auto-selected.

```bash
# Auto-compacts when piped
rover search my-graph@my-variant "search terms" | cat
```

## How search works

Search uses full-text indexing with:

- **camelCase splitting**: `PostConnection` is searchable as "post connection"
- **English stemming**: "creating" matches "create" and "created"
- **BM25 scoring**: Results ranked by relevance across names and descriptions

Each result includes a BFS-discovered shortest path from Query or Mutation roots, with intermediate types expanded at depth 1.

## Schema source

By default, `rover search` fetches the schema from GraphOS using your `APOLLO_KEY`. The schema is cached locally for 5 minutes.
