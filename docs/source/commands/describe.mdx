## Overview

The `rover describe` command provides structured descriptions of your graph's schema. Start with a full schema overview, then zoom into individual types and fields.

<AuthNotice />

## Usage

```bash
rover describe <GRAPH_REF>[:<COORDINATE>] [OPTIONS]
```

| Form | What you get |
|---|---|
| `graph@variant` | Schema overview |
| `graph@variant:Type` | Type description |
| `graph@variant:Type.field` | Field description and return type |

## Examples

### Schema overview

```bash
rover describe my-graph@my-variant
```

This displays the full schema summary including type counts, Query and Mutation fields, and all user-defined types grouped by kind.

### Type description

```bash
rover describe my-graph@my-variant:Post
```

Shows the type's fields, descriptions, interfaces it implements, and the shortest path to reach it from Query or Mutation.

### Field description

```bash
rover describe my-graph@my-variant:User.posts
```

Shows the field's arguments, input type expansion, and return type expansion — everything you need to write a query using this field.

### Depth expansion

```bash
rover describe my-graph@my-variant:Post --depth 1
```

The `--depth` flag expands referenced types by N levels, showing their fields inline. This lets you explore the type graph without viewing the entire schema.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-d, --depth <N>` | Expand referenced types N levels deep (default: 0) |
| `--include-deprecated` | Show deprecated fields and types |
| `--sdl` | Output raw SDL instead of structured description |
| `--compact` | Output token-efficient compact notation |
| `--no-cache` | Skip the local schema cache |
| `--profile <NAME>` | Name of configuration profile to use |

## Output formats

By default, `rover describe` outputs a structured human-readable description. Three alternatives are available:

- **`--sdl`**: Raw SDL, filtered to just the coordinate you asked for
- **`--compact`**: Token-efficient notation (~40% fewer tokens than SDL)
- **`--format json`** (global): Structured JSON output

When output is piped (stdout is not a TTY), compact format is auto-selected unless `--sdl` or `--format json` is specified.

```bash
# Auto-compacts when piped
rover describe my-graph@my-variant:Post | cat
```

## Schema source

By default, `rover describe` fetches the schema from GraphOS using your `APOLLO_KEY`. The schema is cached locally for 5 minutes.
