Rover commands that manage Enterprise licenses for Apollo begin with `rover license`.

## Fetch offline Enterprise license 

### `license fetch`

<Tip>

Offline Enterprise license support is available on an as-needed basis. Send a request to your Apollo contact to enable it for your GraphOS Studio organization.

</Tip>

Run `rover license fetch` to fetch an offline license from GraphOS for a graph with a GraphOS Enterprise plan. Use the fetched license to enable enterprise features while running offline and disconnected from GraphOS, as supported when [running the Apollo Router with an offline license](/router/enterprise-features/#set-up-offline-license-for-the-apollo-router).

Specify the graph to fetch from with a `--graph-id` argument: 

```bash
rover license fetch --graph-id <apollo-graph-id>
```

<Note>

* An offline Enterprise license is valid for the lesser of the duration of your contract with Apollo, or one year, with an added grace period of 28 days. 

* You are responsible for keeping your offline license files up to date within your infrastructure by rerunning `rover license fetch` to fetch updated license files.
