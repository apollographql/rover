Rover commands that manage Enterprise licenses for Apollo begin with `rover license`.

## Fetch offline Enterprise license 

Fetch an offline Enterprise license from GraphOS with `rover license fetch`. Specify the graph with a graph id argument: 

```bash
rover license fetch --graph-id <apollo-graph-id>

<Note>

* An offline Enterprise license is valid for the lesser of the duration of your contract with Apollo, or one year, with an added grace period of 28 days. 

* You are responsible for keeping your offline enterprise license files up to date within your infrastructure.
