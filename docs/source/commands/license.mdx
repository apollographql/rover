Rover commands that manage Enterprise licenses for Apollo begin with `rover license`.

## Fetch offline Enterprise license 

### `license fetch`

Run `rover license fetch` to fetch a license from GraphOS for a graph with a GraphOS Enterprise plan.

Specify the graph to fetch from with a `--graph-id` argument: 

```bash
rover license fetch --graph-id <apollo-graph-id>
```

<Note>

* An offline Enterprise license is valid for the lesser of the duration of your contract with Apollo, or one year, with an added grace period of 28 days. 

* You are responsible for keeping your offline license files up to date within your infrastructure.

</Note>

Run the Apollo Router with a fetched license to enable Enterprise router features while disconnected from GraphOS. For details on using an offline license with the Apollo Router, see [Offline Enterprise license](/router/enterprise-features/#offline-enterprise-license).
