Rover enables you to create a graph with a single interactive command.

## Initializing a graph
### `rover init`

Running `rover init` starts a short wizard that helps you create a new graph.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init
```

The wizard walks you through a set of questions to help you choose the best option for your use case. When you're done, you'll have:

- A new graph in GraphOS
- A set of local configuration files and boilerplate code that represent the graph 
- Credentials to interact with GraphOS
    - These credentials are necessary for actions like [developing your graph locally](/rover/commands/dev) or [publishing graph updates](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/publish).

#### Options

You can also pass options directly to `rover init` to skip parts or all of the wizard. This is useful in automated environments or scripts.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init \
  --project-type <PROJECT_TYPE> \
  --organization <ORGANIZATION> \
  --project-use-case <PROJECT_USE_CASE> \
  --project-name <PROJECT_NAME> \
  --graph-id <GRAPH_ID>
```

Each option passed to `rover init` skips its corresponding wizard prompt. The wizard still asks for any information not provided via an option. To fully automate and skip the entire wizard, you must provide all options. 

##### Available options

| Option | Description | Possible Values |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| `--project-type` | Whether to create a new graph or add a subgraph to an existing graph. | `create-new`, `add-subgraph` |
| `--organization` | The ID of the [GraphOS organization](/graphos/platform/access-management/org#view-your-organizations) where the graph should be created. | *(your org ID)* |
| `--project-use-case` | Helps preconfigure your project for specific patterns. | `connectors`, `graph-ql-template` |
| `--project-name` | The name for your graph. | *(your graph name)* |
| `--graph-id` | The ID to assign to your graph in GraphOS. | *(your graph ID)* |

### Choosing your use case

Once you run `rover init`, the wizard prompts you to select your use case.

- **Start a graph with one or more REST APIs**
    - Select this option to integrate REST APIs into your graph using Apollo Connectors.
- (Coming Soon) **Start a graph with recommended libraries**
    - Select this option if you want to integrate data that's not accessible via a REST API. This option helps you set up a graph using the Apollo Server library.

### Created credentials

After you've chosen your use case, the wizard prompts you for a project name. It generates the following credentials based on the name you enter:

- **Graph ID**- A unique identifier for your graph. It represents your graph across all of Apollo.
- **Graph ref**- A reference for a specific variant of your graph. It's formatted `graph-id@variant`. To start, GraphOS automatically creates a variant titled `current` for you.
- **Graph API key**- Once it's generated, store it securely—you won't be able to access it later.
    - See the [configuration docs](/rover/configuring#with-an-environment-variable) to learn how to set your API key as an environment variable

## Next steps

- Once you've completed the wizard, it provides a [`rover dev`](./dev) command with prepopulated credentials. Run this command to start developing your graph.
