Rover enables you to create a graph with a single interactive command.

## Initializing a graph
### `rover init`

Running `rover init` starts a short wizard that helps you create a new graph.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init
```

The wizard walks you through a set of questions to help you choose the best option for your use case. When you're done, you'll have:

- A new graph in GraphOS
- A set of local configuration files and boilerplate code that represent the graph 
- Credentials to interact with GraphOS
    - These credentials are necessary for actions like [publishing graph updates](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/publish).

### Choosing your use case

Once you run `rover init`, the wizard prompts you to select your use case.

- **Start a graph with one or more REST APIs**
    - Select this option to integrate REST APIs into your graph using Apollo Connectors.
- (Coming Soon) **Start a graph with recommended libraries**
    - Select this option if you want to integrate data that's not accessible via a REST API. This option helps you set up a graph using the Apollo Server library.

### Created credentials

After you've chosen your use case, the wizard prompts you for a project name. It generates the following credentials based on the name you enter:

- **Graph ID**- A unique identifier for your graph. It represents your graph across all of Apollo.
- **Graph ref**- A reference for a specific variant of your graph. It's formatted `graph-id@variant`. To start, GraphOS automatically creates a variant titled `current` for you.
- **Graph API key**- Once it's generated, store it securely—you won't be able to access it later.

## Next steps

- After running `rover init`, follow the instructions in the cloned repository's `getting-started.md`.

- If you learn best with videos and exercises, this [interactive course](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/connectors-intro-rest) teaches you how to integrate a demo REST API into a graph using Apollo Connectors.
