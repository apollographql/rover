`rover init` is an interactive command designed to help you create a new federated graph locally. It generates all the necessary configuration files and boilerplate code required to get started.

## Initializing a graph

Running `rover init` starts a short wizard that helps you create a new graph.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init
```

The wizard walks you through a set of questions to help you choose the best option for your use case. By the end, it generates:

- A set of local files, including a `README.md` and `getting-started.md`
- The necessary credentials to interact with the GraphOS platform

### Choosing your use case

Once you run `rover init`, the wizard prompts you to select your use case.

- **Connect one or more REST APIs**: Select this option to use Apollo Connectors to quickly integrate REST APIs into your graph.
- [Coming Soon] **Start a GraphQL API with recommended libraries**: Select this option if you want to connect data that's not accessible via a REST API. This option helps you set up a GraphQL API using the Apollo Server library.

### Created credentials

After you've chosen your use case, the wizard prompts you for a project name. It generates the following credentials based on the name you enter:

- **Graph ID**- This is a unique identifier for your graph. It represents your graph across all of Apollo.
- **Graph ref**- A graph ref references a specific variant of your graph. It's formatted `graph-id@variant`. To start, GraphOS automatically creates a variant titled `current` for you.
- **Graph API key**- This is your graph's API key. Once it's generated, store it securelyâ€”you won't be able to access it later.

## Next steps

- After running `rover init`, follow the instructions in the cloned repository's `getting-started.md`.

- If you learn best with videos and exercises, this [interactive course](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/connectors-intro-rest) teaches you how to bring an existing REST API into a GraphQL API using Apollo Connectors.
