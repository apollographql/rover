Rover enables you to create a graph with a single interactive command.

## Initializing a graph
### `rover init`

Running `rover init` starts a short wizard that helps you create a new graph.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init
```

The wizard walks you through a set of questions to help you choose the best option for your use case. When you're done, you'll have:

- A new graph in GraphOS
- A set of local configuration files and boilerplate code that represent the graph 
- Credentials to interact with GraphOS
    - These credentials are necessary for actions like [developing your graph locally](/rover/commands/dev) or [publishing graph updates](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/publish).

#### Options

You can also pass options directly to `rover init` instead of answering prompts in the wizard. The wizard still asks for any information not provided via an option and will always ask for confirmation before creating any files locally.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init \
  --project-type <PROJECT_TYPE> \
  --org-id <ORGANIZATION_ID> \
  --project-use-case <PROJECT_USE_CASE> \
  --project-name <PROJECT_NAME> \
  --graph-id <GRAPH_ID>
```

##### Available options

| Option | Description | Possible Values |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| `--project-type` | Whether to create a new graph or add a subgraph to an existing graph. | `create-new`, <br/>`add-subgraph` |
| `--org-id` | The ID of the [GraphOS organization](/graphos/platform/access-management/org#view-your-organizations) where the graph should be created. | *(your organization ID)* |
| `--project-use-case` | Helps preconfigure your graph for specific patterns. | `connectors`, <br/>`graph-ql-template` |
| `--project-name` | The name for your new graph. | *(your graph name)* |
| `--graph-id` | The ID for your graph in GraphOS. (This must be a unique identifier.) | *(your graph ID)* |

### Choosing your use case

Once you run `rover init`, the wizard prompts you to select your use case.

- **Start a graph with one or more REST APIs**
    - Select this option to integrate REST APIs into your graph using Apollo Connectors.
- **Start a graph with recommended libraries**
    - Select this option if you want to integrate data that's not accessible via a REST API. This option helps you set up a graph using the Apollo Server library.

### Created credentials

After you've chosen your use case, the wizard prompts you for a project name. It generates the following credentials based on the name you enter:

- **Graph ID**- A unique identifier for your graph. It represents your graph across all of Apollo.
- **Graph ref**- A reference for a specific variant of your graph. It's formatted `graph-id@variant`. To start, GraphOS automatically creates a variant titled `current` for you.
- **Graph API key**- Once it's generated, store it securelyâ€”you won't be able to access it later.
    - See the [configuration docs](/rover/configuring#with-an-environment-variable) to learn how to set your API key as an environment variable

## Next steps

Once you've completed the wizard, it provides a [`rover dev`](./dev) command with prepopulated credentials. Run this command to start developing your graph.

<Note>

    If you started with TypeScript, you also need to run the following commands in a separate terminal window before running `rover dev`:

    ```terminal
    npm ci
    npm start
    ```

    These commands start a subgraph server that `rover dev` depends on. Learn more in the `getting-started.md` generated when you run `rover init`.
