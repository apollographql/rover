`rover init` is an interactive command designed to help you create a new federated graph locally. It generates all the necessary configuration files and boilerplate code required to get started.

## Initializing a graph

Running `rover init` starts a short wizard that helps you create your new GraphQL API project.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init
```

The wizard walks you through a set of questions to help you choose the best option for your use case. By the end, it generates both a local project and a set of credentials necessary to interact with the GraphOS platform.

### Created credentials

- **Graph ref**- A graph ref references a specific graph in the GraphOS platform. It's formatted `graph-id@variant`. To start, GraphOS automatically creates a variant titled `current` for you.
- **Graph ID**- This is a unique identifier for your graph. It represents your graph across all of Apollo.
- **Graph API key**- This is your graph's API key. Once it's generated, store it securelyâ€”you won't be able to access it later.

### Choosing your use case
