`rover init` is an interactive command designed to help you create a new federated graph locally. It generates all the necessary configuration files and boilerplate code required to get started.

## Initializing a graph

Running `rover init` starts a short wizard that helps you create your new GraphQL API project.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init
```

The wizard walks you through a set of questions to help you choose the best option for your use case. By the end, it generates:

- A set of local files, including a README.md
- The necessary credentials to interact with the GraphOS platform

### Choosing your use case

Once you run `rover init`, the wizard prompts you to select your use case.

- **Connect one or more REST APIs**: Select this option to use Apollo Connectors to quickly integrate REST APIs into your graph.
- [Coming Soon] **Start a GraphQL API with recommended libraries**: Select this option if you want to connect data that's not accessible via a REST API. This option helps you set up a GraphQL API using the Apollo Server library.

### Created credentials

After you've chosen your use case, the wizard prompts you for a project name. It generates the following credentials based on the name you enter:

- **Graph ID**- This is a unique identifier for your graph. It represents your graph across all of Apollo.
- **Graph ref**- A graph ref references a specific variant of your graph. It's formatted `graph-id@variant`. To start, GraphOS automatically creates a variant titled `current` for you.
- **Graph API key**- This is your graph's API key. Once it's generated, store it securelyâ€”you won't be able to access it later.

### Using Apollo's IDE extensions

Finally, the wizard asks if you would like your project to include settings for one of Apollo's IDE extensions. See the dedicated documentation pages linked on the [IDE extensions overview](/graphos/schema-design/ide-support) for further configuration instructions.
