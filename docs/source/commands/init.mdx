Rover enables you to create a graph or MCP server with a single interactive command.

## Initializing a graph
### `rover init`

Running `rover init` starts a short wizard that helps you create a new graph.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init
```

The wizard walks you through a set of questions to help you choose the best option for your use case. When you're done, you'll have:

- A new graph in GraphOS
- A set of local configuration files and boilerplate code that represent the graph 
- Credentials to interact with GraphOS
    - These credentials are necessary for actions like [developing your graph locally](/rover/commands/dev) or [publishing graph updates](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/publish).

#### Options

You can also pass options directly to `rover init` instead of answering prompts in the wizard. The wizard still asks for any information not provided via an option and will always ask for confirmation before creating any files locally.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init \
  --project-type <PROJECT_TYPE> \
  --org-id <ORGANIZATION_ID> \
  --project-use-case <PROJECT_USE_CASE> \
  --project-name <PROJECT_NAME> \
  --graph-id <GRAPH_ID>
```

For `rover init --mcp` options, see the [Initializing an MCP Server](#initializing-an-mcp-server) section.

##### Available options

| Option | Description | Possible Values |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| `--project-type` | Whether to create a new graph or add a subgraph to an existing graph. | `create-new`, <br/>`add-subgraph` |
| `--org-id` | The ID of the [GraphOS organization](/graphos/platform/access-management/org#view-your-organizations) where the graph should be created. | *(your organization ID)* |
| `--project-use-case` | Helps preconfigure your graph for specific patterns. | `connectors`, <br/>`graph-ql-template` |
| `--project-name` | The name for your new graph. | *(your graph name)* |
| `--graph-id` | The ID for your graph in GraphOS. (This must be a unique identifier.) | *(your graph ID)* |
| `--mcp` | See the [Initializing an MCP Server](#initializing-an-mcp-server) section.|  |

#### Choosing your use case

Once you run `rover init`, the wizard prompts you to select your use case.

- **Start a graph with one or more REST APIs**
    - Select this option to integrate REST APIs into your graph using Apollo Connectors.
- **Start a graph with recommended libraries**
    - Select this option if you want to integrate data that's not accessible via a REST API. This option helps you set up a graph using the Apollo Server library.

#### Created credentials

After you've chosen your use case, the wizard prompts you for a project name. It generates the following credentials based on the name you enter:

- **Graph ID**- A unique identifier for your graph. It represents your graph across all of Apollo.
- **Graph ref**- A reference for a specific variant of your graph. It's formatted `graph-id@variant`. To start, GraphOS automatically creates a variant titled `current` for you.
- **Graph API key**- Once it's generated, store it securely—you won't be able to access it later.
    - See the [configuration docs](/rover/configuring#with-an-environment-variable) to learn how to set your API key as an environment variable

### Next steps

Once you've completed the wizard, it provides a [`rover dev`](./dev) command with prepopulated credentials. Run this command to start developing your graph.

        ```terminal showLineNumbers=false
        rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph.yaml

        ##### Command Prompt

        ```terminal showLineNumbers=false
        rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph.yaml
        ```

        </Tab>

    </Tabs>

<Note>

    If you started with TypeScript, you also need to run the following commands in a separate terminal window before running `rover dev`:

    ```terminal
    npm ci
    npm start
    ```

    These commands start a subgraph server that `rover dev` depends on. Learn more in the `GETTING_STARTED.md` generated when you run `rover init`.

- If you learn best with videos and exercises, this [interactive course](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/connectors-intro-rest) teaches you how to integrate a demo REST API into a graph using Apollo Connectors.

## Initializing an MCP server
### `rover init --mcp`

Rover's `init --mcp` command provides a helpful starting point for working with the [Apollo MCP Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-mcp-server). 

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init --mcp
```

The `init` CLI wizard walks you through the process of configuring and creating an MCP server, with MCP tools based on your GraphQL API operations.

The command creates the following files:

- MCP config YAML for local and staging scenarios
- MCP config for adding to Claude Desktop
- Starter [MCP tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-mcp-server/define-tools), based on your GraphQL API operations
- `.env` files for running the GraphQL API and MCP Server
- A set of local configuration files and boilerplate code that represent the graph
- mcp.Dockerfile (optional Docker container) 

##### Options

You can also pass options directly to `rover init --mcp` instead of answering prompts in the wizard. The wizard still asks for any information not provided via an option and always asks for confirmation before creating any files locally.

```terminal showLineNumbers=false
rover init --mcp \
  --project-type <PROJECT_TYPE> \
  --org-id <ORGANIZATION_ID> \
  --project-name <PROJECT_NAME> \
  --graph-id <GRAPH_ID>
```

##### Available options

| Option | Description | Possible Values |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| `--project-type` | Whether to create MCP tools from a new Apollo GraphOS project or an existing Apollo GraphOS project. | `create-new`, <br/>`add-subgraph` |
| `--org-id` | The ID of the [GraphOS organization](/graphos/platform/access-management/org#view-your-organizations) where the graph should be created. | *(your organization ID)* |
| `--project-name` | The name for your new graph. | *(your graph name)* |
| `--graph-id` | The ID for your graph in GraphOS. (This must be a unique identifier.) | *(your graph ID)* |


### Next Steps

#### Run your MCP server

When the `rover init` wizard is complete, you can use [`rover dev`](./dev) to start everything together. See [Running the Apollo MCP Server](/apollo-mcp-server/run).

#### Connect your MCP server to Claude Desktop

```bash
# Copy and provide the configuration to Claude Desktop
# macOS:
cp claude_desktop_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Windows:
copy claude_desktop_config.json "%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json"

# Linux:
cp claude_desktop_config.json ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Restart Claude Desktop
```
