title: The Rover dev command
description: Query multiple GraphQL APIs from localhost
---

`rover dev` starts a local router that can query across one or more running GraphQL APIs (subgraphs)
through one endpoint (supergraph). As you add, edit, and remove subgraphs, `rover dev` automatically
composes all of their schemas into a new supergraph schema, and the router reloads. 

Think plug-n-play USB devices but with your GraphQL APIs!

⚠️ Do not run this command in production! ⚠️ It is intended for local development.

## Starting the first `rover dev` session

Before starting `rover dev`, you need to start your GraphQL API (subgraph). Note the URL it is running on, and the location of the schema on the filesystem if it exists. If you don't have a local schema file, introspection will need to be enabled on the subgraph.

An example `rover dev` invocation might look something like this:

`npm run start && rover dev --name products --schema ./products.graphql --url http://localhost:4000`

This will start the main `rover dev` session, watching `./products.graphql` for changes to the schema, and start up a local Apollo Router that can be queried at http://localhost:3000. This session will start listening for other `rover dev` sessions that include other subgraph schemas.

### Stopping the first `rover dev` session

If you stop the first `rover dev` session (by pressing ctrl+c), it will shut down the router and any attached `rover dev` sessions will be detached and shut down.

## Attaching more subgraphs to the main `rover dev` session

For each new subgraph, run `rover dev` in a new terminal with the necessary arguments that refer to your GraphQL API (subgraph). If the `--supergraph-port` argument is equivalent to a running `rover dev` session, the new session will attach to the running session and provide it with updates to the subgraph schema. The main session will then re-compose the supergraph schema, printing the build result in the output of the main session and the attached session.

## Triggering composition on subgraph changes

Each `rover dev` session is responsible for monitoring its subgraph schema.

### Via filesystem update _(recommended)_

If you pass the `--schema <PATH>` argument, `rover dev` will watch the schema file for changes and report the schema update to the main `rover dev` session when its contents change.

### Via introspection _(not recommended)_

If you do not pass the `--schema <PATH>` argument, `rover dev` will introspect the URL that was specified by the `--url <SUBGRAPH_URL>` argument once every second. The command prefers to use the same query as `rover subgraph introspect`, but it will fall back to `rover graph introspect` if your GraphQL API does not support introspecting federated SDL. Note that in this case directives will be stripped from the subgraph schema.

### Stopping an attached `rover dev` session

If you stop an attached `rover dev` session (by pressing ctrl+c), the supergraph will de-compose that subgraph and reload the router.

### Federation 2 ELv2 license

The first time you use Federation 2 composition on a particular machine, Rover prompts you to accept the terms and conditions of the [ELv2 license](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/elastic-license-v2-faq/). On future invocations, Rover remembers that you already accepted the license and doesn't prompt you again (even if you update Rover).

The ELv2-licensed plugins, `supergraph` (built from [this source](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-rs)) and `router` (built from [this source](https://github.com/apollographql/router)) are installed to `~/.rover/bin` if you installed with the `curl | sh` installer, and to `./node_modules/.bin/` if you installed with npm.
