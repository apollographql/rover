title: Rover graph commands
description: Publish and retrieve your API schema
---

These Rover commands are _primarily_ for interacting with monolithic graphs that do _not_ use [federation](/federation/). However, you can also use them to fetch a federated graph's API schema [from Apollo Studio](#graph-fetch) or [via introspection](#graph-introspect).

> To fetch a federated graph's _supergraph_ schema instead of its _API_ schema, use [`supergraph` commands](./supergraphs/). [Learn about different schema types.](/federation/federated-types/overview/)
>
> When interacting directly with a federated subgraph, instead use [`subgraph` commands](./subgraphs/).

## Fetching a schema

### `graph fetch`

> This command requires [authenticating Rover with Apollo Studio](../configuring/#authenticating-with-apollo-studio).

You can use Rover to fetch the current schema of any Studio graph and variant it has access to.

Run the `graph fetch` command, like so:

```bash
rover graph fetch my-graph@my-variant
```

The argument `my-graph@my-variant` in the example above specifies the ID of the Studio graph you're fetching from, along with which [variant](/studio/org/graphs/#variants) you're fetching.

> You can omit `@` and the variant name. If you do, Rover uses the default variant, named `current`.

### `graph introspect`

If you need to obtain the schema of a running GraphQL server or federated gateway, you can use Rover to execute an introspection query on it. This is especially helpful if you're developing a GraphQL server that _doesn't_ define its schema via SDL, such as [`graphql-kotlin`](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/graphql-kotlin).

Use the `graph introspect` command, like so:

```shell
rover graph introspect http://example.com/graphql
```

The server must be reachable by Rover and it must have introspection enabled.

#### Watching for schema changes

If you pass `--watch` to `rover graph introspect`, Rover introspects your GraphQL endpoint every second. Whenever the returned schema differs from the _previously_ returned schema, Rover outputs the updated schema.  

#### Including headers

If the endpoint you're trying to reach requires HTTP headers, you can use the `--header` (`-H`) flag to pass `key:value` pairs of headers. If you have multiple headers to pass, use the header multiple times. If the header includes any spaces, the pair must be quoted.

```shell
rover graph introspect http://example.com/graphql --header "Authorization: Bearer token329r"
```

### Output format

By default, both `graph fetch` and `graph introspect` output fetched [SDL](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl) to `stdout`. This is useful for providing the schema as input to _other_ Rover commands:

```shell
rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph publish my-graph@dev --schema -
```

You can also save the output to a local `.graphql` file like so:

```bash
# Creates prod-schema.graphql or overwrites if it already exists
rover graph fetch my-graph@my-variant > prod-schema.graphql
```

> For more on passing values via `stdout`, see [Conventions](../conventions#using-stdout).

## Publishing a schema to Apollo Studio

### `graph publish`

> This command requires [authenticating Rover with Apollo Studio](../configuring/#authenticating-with-apollo-studio).

You can use Rover to publish schema changes to one of your [Apollo Studio graphs](/studio/org/graphs/).

Use the `graph publish` command, like so:

```shell
rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql
```

The argument `my-graph@my-variant` in the example above specifies the ID of the Studio graph you're publishing to, along with which [variant](/studio/org/graphs/#variants) you're publishing to.

> You can omit `@` and the variant name. If you do, Rover publishes the schema to the default variant, named `current`.

If the graph exists in the graph registry, but the variant does not, a new variant will be created on publish.

### Providing the schema

You provide your schema to Rover commands via the `--schema` option. The value is usually the path to a local `.graphql` or `.gql` file in [SDL format](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl).

If your schema isn't stored in a compatible file, you can provide `-` as the value of the `--schema` flag to instead accept an SDL string from `stdin`. This enables you to pipe the output of _another_ Rover command (such as `graph introspect`), like so:

```shell
rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph publish my-graph@dev --schema -
```

Whenever possible, we recommend publishing a `.graphql` file directly instead of using introspection. An introspection result omits schema comments and most uses of directives.

> For more on accepting input via `stdin`, see [Conventions](../conventions#using-stdin).

## Checking schema changes

### `graph check`

Before you [publish schema changes to Apollo Studio](#publishing-a-schema-to-apollo-studio), you can [check those changes](/graphos/delivery/schema-checks/) to confirm that you aren't introducing breaking changes to your application clients.

To do so, you can run the `graph check` command:

```shell
# Using a schema file
rover graph check my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

# Using piped input to stdin
rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph check my-graph --schema -
```

As shown, arguments and options are similar to [`graph publish`](#graph-publish).

To configure the behavior of schema checks (such as the time range of past operations to check against), see the [documentation for schema checks](/studio/check-configurations/#using-apollo-studio-recommended).

If you don't want to wait for the check to complete, you can run the command with the `--background` flag. You can then look up the check's result in Apollo Studio on the Checks tab.

#### Running checks in CI

If you're running schema checks in CI, you might want to pass the `--background` flag to `rover graph check`. This flag instructs Rover to initiate schema checks but _not_ await their result. If you've [connected Apollo Studio to your GitHub repository](/graphos/delivery/github-integration/), the integration detects the checks execution and adds a status to the associated pull request.

## Deleting a variant

### `graph delete`

> This command requires [authenticating Rover with Apollo Studio](../configuring/#authenticating-with-apollo-studio).

You can delete a single variant of a graph by running `rover graph delete`:

```bash
# ⚠️ This action is irreversible!
rover graph delete my-graph@variant-to-delete
```

This command prompts you for confirmation because the action is irreversible. You can bypass confirmation by passing the `--confirm` flag.

If you delete a federated variant with this command, it _also_ deletes all of that variant's subgraphs. To delete a single subgraph while preserving the variant, see [Deleting a subgraph](./subgraphs/#deleting-a-subgraph).
