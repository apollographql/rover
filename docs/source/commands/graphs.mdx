subtitle: Publish and retrieve your API schema
description: Use Rover CLI commands to interact with graphs and fetch GraphQL API schemas from GraphOS or via introspection.
---

import AuthNotice from '../../shared/auth-notice.mdx';

These Rover commands are primarily for interacting with [monographs](/graphos/graphs/overview/#monographs) that do not use [federation](/federation/). However, you can also use them to fetch a federated graph's API schema [from GraphOS](#graph-fetch) or [via introspection](#graph-introspect).

<Note>

- To fetch a federated graph's supergraph schema instead of its API schema, use [`supergraph` commands](./supergraphs/). [Learn about different schema types.](/federation/federated-types/overview/)
- When interacting directly with a federated subgraph, instead use [`subgraph` commands](./subgraphs/).

</Note>

## Fetching a schema

### `graph fetch`

<AuthNotice />

You can use Rover to fetch the current schema of any GraphOS graph and variant it has access to.

Run the `graph fetch` command, like so:

```bash
rover graph fetch my-graph@my-variant
```

The argument `my-graph@my-variant` in the example above specifies the ID of the Studio graph you're fetching from, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/#variants) you're fetching.

If you omit `@` and the variant name, Rover uses the supergraph's default variant, named `current`.

### `graph introspect`

If you need to obtain the schema of a running GraphQL server or federated gateway, you can use Rover to execute an introspection query on it. This is especially helpful if you're developing a GraphQL server that doesn't define its schema via SDL, such as [`graphql-kotlin`](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/graphql-kotlin).

Use the `graph introspect` command, like so:

```shell
rover graph introspect http://example.com/graphql
```

The server must be reachable by Rover and it must have introspection enabled.

#### Watching for schema changes

If you pass `--watch` to `rover graph introspect`, Rover introspects your GraphQL endpoint every second. Whenever the returned schema differs from the previously returned schema, Rover outputs the updated schema.  

#### Including headers

If the endpoint you're trying to reach requires HTTP headers, you can use the `--header` (`-H`) flag to pass `key:value` pairs of headers. If you have multiple headers to pass, use the header multiple times. If the header includes any spaces, the pair must be quoted.

```shell
rover graph introspect http://example.com/graphql --header "Authorization: Bearer token329r"
```

### Output format

By default, both `graph fetch` and `graph introspect` output fetched [SDL](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl) to `stdout`. This is useful for providing the schema as input to other Rover commands:

```shell
rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph publish my-graph@dev --schema -
```

You can also save the output to a local `.graphql` file like so:

```bash
# Creates prod-schema.graphql or overwrites if it already exists
rover graph fetch my-graph@my-variant --output prod-schema.graphql
```

For more on passing values via `stdout`, see [Conventions](../conventions#using-stdout).

## Publishing a schema to GraphOS

### `graph publish`

<AuthNotice />

You can use Rover to publish schema changes to one of your [GraphOS monographs](/graphos/graphs/#monographs).

Use the `graph publish` command, like so:

```shell
rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql
```

The argument `my-graph@my-variant` in the example above specifies the ID of the GraphOS graph you're publishing to, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/#variants) you're publishing to.

If the graph exists in GraphOS but the variant doesn't, a new variant is be created on publish.

### Providing the schema

You provide your schema to Rover commands via the `--schema` option. The value is usually the path to a local `.graphql` or `.gql` file in [SDL format](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl).

If your schema isn't stored in a compatible file, you can provide `-` as the value of the `--schema` flag to instead accept an SDL string from `stdin`. This enables you to pipe the output of another Rover command (such as `graph introspect`), like so:

```shell
rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph publish my-graph@dev --schema -
```

Whenever possible, we recommend publishing a `.graphql` file directly instead of using introspection. An introspection result omits schema comments and most uses of directives.

For more on accepting input via `stdin`, see [Conventions](../conventions#using-stdin).

## Validating schema changes

### `graph check`

<AuthNotice />

Before you [publish schema changes to GraphOS](#publishing-a-schema-to-graphos), you can [check those changes](/graphos/delivery/schema-checks/) to confirm that you aren't introducing breaking changes to your application clients.

To do so, you can run the `graph check` command:

```shell
# Using a schema file
rover graph check my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

# Using piped input to stdin
rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph check my-graph --schema -
```

As shown, arguments and options are similar to [`graph publish`](#graph-publish).

To configure the behavior of schema checks (such as the time range of past operations to check against), see the [documentation for schema checks](/graphos/delivery/check-configurations/#using-apollo-studio-recommended).

If you don't want to wait for the check to complete, you can run the command with the `--background` flag. You can then look up the check's result in GraphOS Studio on the Checks tab.

#### Running checks in CI

If you're running schema checks in CI, you might want to pass the `--background` flag to `rover graph check`. This flag instructs Rover to initiate schema checks but not await their result. If you've [connected GraphOS to your GitHub repository](/graphos/delivery/github-integration/), the integration detects the checks execution and adds a status to the associated pull request.

### `graph lint`

<AuthNotice />

You can run the GraphOS schema linter against your local schema to identify any violations of formatting and naming best practices:

```bash title="Example command"
rover graph lint --schema ./schema.graphql my-graph@my-variant
```

The argument `my-graph@my-variant` in the example above is a **graph ref** that specifies the ID of the graph you're comparing your schema changes against, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/#variants) you're comparing against.

Schema linting also runs as one of the checks included in [`graph check`](#graph-check). Use this command to perform one-off linting.

Options include:

<table class="field-table">

###### `--schema`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** The path to a local `.graphql` or `.gql` file, in [SDL format](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl).

Alternatively, you can provide `-`, in which case the command uses an SDL string piped to `stdin` instead (see [Using `stdin`](../conventions#using-stdin)).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `--ignore-existing-lint-violations`

</td>

If provided, the linter only flags violations that are present in the diff between your local schema and your published schema.

By default, this command flags all violations in your local schema.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>

## Deleting a variant

### `graph delete`

<AuthNotice />

You can delete a single variant of a graph by running `rover graph delete`:

```bash
# ⚠️ This action is irreversible!
rover graph delete my-graph@variant-to-delete
```

This command prompts you for confirmation because the action is irreversible. You can bypass confirmation by passing the `--confirm` flag.

If you delete a federated variant with this command, it also deletes all of that variant's subgraphs. To delete a single subgraph while preserving the variant, see [Deleting a subgraph](./subgraphs/#deleting-a-subgraph).
