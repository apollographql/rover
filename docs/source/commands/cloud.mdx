Rover enables you to manage cloud resources with the `rover cloud` set of commands. The commands allow you to manage cloud router configurations for a given graph ref.

## Cloud Router Config

### `cloud config fetch`

The `cloud config fetch` attempts to fetch the current cloud router config for a given graph ref:

```
$ rover cloud config fetch <GRAPH_REF>
```

### `cloud config update`


The `cloud config update` attempts to update a cloud router config for a given graph ref:

```
$ rover cloud config update --file <FILE> <GRAPH_REF>

Successfully updated cloud router config!
```

### `cloud config validate`

The `cloud config validate` attempts to validate a cloud router config for a given graph ref:

```
$ rover cloud config validate --file <FILE> <GRAPH_REF>

No errors!
```

An invalid config will have the associated errors shown. For example, passing an invalid key/value pair `invalid: true`, as a `header` produces the following:
```
$ rover cloud config validate --file <FILE> <GRAPH_REF>

error: Invalid router config: Router configuration failed to validate: router_config(/headers): Additional properties are not allowed ('invalid' was unexpected)
```
