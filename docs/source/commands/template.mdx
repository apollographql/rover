title: Rover template commands
description: For use with Apollo Federation
---

A **supergraph** (also called a federated graph) is a graph composed of multiple **subgraphs**:

```mermaid
graph BT;
  gateway(["Supergraph (A + B + C)"]);
  serviceA[Subgraph A];
  serviceB[Subgraph B];
  serviceC[Subgraph C];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
```

Rover template commands help you create new subgraphs from templated projects in various [Federation-compatible implementations](/federation/supported-subgraphs).

This feature is intended to help quickly start up a new GraphQL project and enable new developers to explore various implementations. If you have an idea or want to contribute a specific template, open an issue here!

## Using the wizard to create a new subgraph project

You can use `rover template use` to start a wizard that will help you create a new subgraph project.

> You will be prompted through a series of questions to filter down to the exact template you want to use.

You can optionally provide a `--path` option to specify which relative path to create the project in. If you do not provide a path, the project will be created in a new directory named the ID of the template.

```bash
rover template use --path <PATH>
```

### Project types

You will be prompted to select which type of project you want to generate. You can optionally provide a `--project-type` option to skip this prompt.

> Run `rover template use --help` to see a list of available project types.

```shell
rover template use --path="my-new-subgraph" --project-type=subgraph
```

### Project Languages

You will be prompted to choose a programming language for your project. You can optionally provide a `--language` option to skip this prompt.

> Run `rover template use --help` to see a list of available languages.

```shell
rover template use --path="my-new-python-subgraph" --language=python
```

## Skipping the wizard

If you know exactly which template you want to use, you can specify the `--template` option to skip the wizard:

```shell
rover template use --path="my-new-apollo-server-subgraph" --template="subgraph-javascript-apollo-server"
```

> Use `rover template list` to see a list of available templates.

## Listing available templates

`rover template list` will list all available templates with their ID (for use with `--template` argument to `rover template use`), name, project type, language, and Repo URL. To learn more about a specific template, go to the Repo URL and read the template's `README.md`.

This command accepts the same `--project-type` and `--language` options as `rover template use` to filter the list of templates.

> For a machine-readable output, use the `--json` flag.
