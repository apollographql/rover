title: Rover contract commands
description: For use with Apollo Contract variants
---

A **contract** is a variant that is the result of filtering out schema elements from a source variant.

Rover commands that interact with [contracts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/contracts/) begin with `rover contract`.

## Publishing a contract to Apollo Studio

### `contract publish`

> This command requires [authenticating Rover with Apollo Studio](../configuring/#authenticating-with-apollo-studio).

You can use Rover to publish a new contract or publish configuration changes to an existing contract.

Run the `contract publish` command, like so:

```bash
rover contract publish my-graph@my-contract-variant \
  --source-variant my-source-variant \
  --include foo --include bar \
  --exclude baz \
  --hide-unreachable-types
```

The argument `my-graph@my-contract-variant` in the example above is a [graph ref](../conventions/#graph-refs) that specifies the ID of the Studio graph you're publishing to, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/overview/#variants) you're publishing to.

If this variant already exists in the graph registry, its configuration is updated; otherwise, a new contract variant is created.

Options include:

###### `--source-variant`

</td>
<td>

The name of the [source variant](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/contracts/#2-fed1-enable-variant-support-for-tag) whose supergraph schema is used for filtering.

This variant must be on the same graph as the contract variant and cannot be changed after contract creation. It must also be a federated variant with subgraphs, and if using Fed 1, support for the `@tag` directive must be explicitly enabled in Studio.

**Required** the first time you publish a contract.

**Optional** after your first publish, but if provided it must match the source variant in Studio.

###### `--include`

</td>
<td>

**Required unless `--no-include` is used.** A tag name to [include](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/contracts/#contract-filters) when filtering. To include multiple tag names, specify `--include` multiple times (e.g. `--include foo --include bar`). To include no tag names/use an empty list, specify `--no-include` instead.

Every tag name **must**:

* Begin with a letter (capital or lowercase) or underscore.
* Include only letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), or slashes (`/`).
* Have a maximum of 128 characters.

**Required unless `--include` is used.** [Include](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/contracts/#contract-filters) no tag names when filtering. To include a non-empty list of tag names, specify `--include` instead.

**Required unless `--no-exclude` is used.** A tag name to [exclude](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/contracts/#contract-filters) when filtering. To exclude multiple tag names, specify `--exclude` multiple times (e.g. `--exclude foo --exclude bar`). To exclude no tag names/use an empty list, specify `--no-exclude` instead.

## Describing a contract variant

### `contract describe`

> This command requires [authenticating Rover with Apollo Studio](../configuring/#authenticating-with-apollo-studio).

You can use Rover to describe the configuration of any contract variant that Rover has access to.

Run the `contract describe` command, like so:

```bash
rover contract describe my-graph@my-contract-variant
```

The argument `my-graph@my-contract-variant` in the example above is a [graph ref](../conventions/#graph-refs) that specifies the ID of the Studio graph you're fetching from, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/overview/#variants) you're fetching.

The output will contain information of how the contract variant was configured such as the source variant, include and exclude tags.

```
Fetching description for configuration of my-graph@my-contract-variant using credentials from the default profile.

Configuration Description: Contract variant "my-graph@my-contract-variant" uses the source variant "my-graph@my-source-variant". It is configured to include the tag names "foo" and "bar", exclude the tag name "baz", and automatically hide unreachable types.
