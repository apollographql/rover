title: Rover subgraph commands
---

import AuthNotice from "../../shared/auth-notice.mdx";

A **subgraph** is a graph that contributes to the composition of a federated **supergraph**:

```mermaid
graph BT;
  gateway(["Supergraph (A + B + C)"]);
  serviceA[Subgraph A];
  serviceB[Subgraph B];
  serviceC[Subgraph C];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
```

Rover commands that interact with subgraphs begin with `rover subgraph`.

## Fetching a subgraph schema

These commands enable you to fetch the schema for a single subgraph in a supergraph. To instead fetch the API schema for a supergraph, use [`rover graph fetch`](./graphs#graph-fetch). To fetch the supergraph schema, use [`rover supergraph fetch`](./supergraphs#supergraph-fetch).

### `subgraph fetch`

<AuthNotice />

You can use Rover to fetch the current schema of any subgraph that belongs to a Studio graph and variant that Rover has access to.

Run the `subgraph fetch` command, like so:

```bash
rover subgraph fetch my-graph@my-variant --name accounts
```

The argument `my-graph@my-variant` in the example above is a [graph ref](../conventions/#graph-refs) that specifies the ID of the Studio graph you're fetching from, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/#variants) you're fetching.

**The `--name` option is required.** It specifies _which_ subgraph you're fetching the schema for.

### `subgraph introspect`

If you need to obtain a running subgraph's schema, you can use Rover to execute an enhanced introspection query on it. This is especially helpful if the subgraph _doesn't_ define its schema via SDL (as is the case with [`graphql-kotlin`](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/graphql-kotlin)).

Use the `subgraph introspect` command, like so:

```bash
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4001
```

The subgraph must be reachable by Rover. The subgraph does _not_ need to have introspection enabled.

> Unlike a standard introspection query, the result of `rover subgraph introspect` _does_ include certain directives (specifically, directives related to federation like `@key`). This is possible because the command uses a separate introspection mechanism provided by the [Apollo Federation subgraph specification](/federation/subgraph-spec/#enhanced-introspection-with-query_service).

#### Watching for schema changes

If you pass `--watch` to `rover subgraph introspect`, Rover introspects your subgraph every second. Whenever the returned schema differs from the _previously_ returned schema, Rover outputs the updated schema. This is most useful when combined with the `--output <OUTPUT_FILE>` argument which will write the introspection response out to a file whenever its contents change.

#### Including headers

If the endpoint you're trying to reach requires HTTP headers, you can use the `--header` (`-H`) flag to pass `key:value` pairs of headers. If you have multiple headers to pass, provide the flag multiple times. If a header includes any spaces, the pair must be quoted.

```shell
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4001 --header "Authorization: Bearer token329r"
```

### Output format

```sh
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4001\
  | rover subgraph publish my-graph@dev\
  --schema - --name accounts\
  --routing-url https://my-running-subgraph.com/api
```

By default, both `subgraph fetch` and `subgraph introspect` output fetched [SDL](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl) to `stdout`. This is useful for providing the schema as input to _other_ Rover commands:

```shell
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover subgraph check my-graph --schema -
```

You can also save the output to a local `.graphql` file like so:

```bash
# Creates accounts-schema.graphql or overwrites if it already exists
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 --output accounts-schema.graphql
```

> For more on passing values via `stdout`, see [Using `stdout`](../conventions#using-stdout).

## Listing subgraphs in a supergraph

### `subgraph list`

<AuthNotice />

You can use the `subgraph list` to list all of a particular supergraph's available subgraphs in GraphOS:

```bash
rover subgraph list my-supergraph@staging
```

This command lists all subgraphs for the specified variant, including their routing URLs and when they were last updated (in local time). A link to view this information in Apollo Studio is also provided.

```
Subgraphs:

+----------+-------------- --------------+----------------------------+
| Name     | Routing Url                 | Last Updated               |

## Publishing a subgraph schema to GraphOS

### `subgraph publish`

<AuthNotice />

You can use Rover to publish schema changes to a subgraph in one of your GraphOS-managed [supergraphs](/graphos/graphs/).

Use the `subgraph publish` command, like so:

```bash
rover subgraph publish my-supergraph@my-variant \
  --schema "./accounts/schema.graphql" \
  --name accounts \
  --routing-url "https://my-running-subgraph.com/api"
```

The argument `my-supergraph@my-variant` in the example above is a [graph ref](../conventions/#graph-refs) that specifies the ID of the GraphOS graph you're publishing to, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/#variants) you're publishing to.

> You can omit `@` and the variant name. If you do, Rover publishes the schema to the default variant, named `current`.

If the graph exists in the graph registry but the variant does _not_, a new variant is created on publish.

Options include:

<table class="field-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `--schema`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** The path to a local `.graphql` or `.gql` file, in [SDL format](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl).

Alternatively, you can provide `-`, in which case the command uses an SDL string piped to `stdin` instead (see [Using `stdin`](../conventions#using-stdin)).

</td>
</tr>

<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `--name`

</td>

<td>

**Required.** The name of the subgraph to publish to.

Every subgraph name **must**:

- Begin with a letter (capital or lowercase)
- Include only letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`)
- Have a maximum of 64 characters

</td>
</tr>

<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `--routing-url`

</td>

<td>

The URL that your supergraph uses to communicate with the subgraph in a [managed federation architecture](/federation/managed-federation/overview/).

**Required** the first time you publish a particular subgraph. If your subgraph isn't deployed yet, or if you aren't using managed federation, you can pass an empty string. Passing an empty string requires you to set the `--allow-invalid-routing-url` flag.

**Optional** after your first publish. Provide only if you need to change the subgraph's routing URL.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

###### `--convert`

</td>

<td>

If a monolithic schema for this variant already exists in the graph registry instead of multiple subgraph schemas, you need to run `rover subgraph publish` with the `--convert` flag to convert this variant to a federated graph with one or more subgraphs.

This _permanently_ deletes the monolithic schema from this variant and replaces it with a single subgraph. In many cases, you need to run `subgraph publish` for multiple or _all_ of your subgraphs before Studio can successfully compose a supergraph schema.

This option has no effect if you publish to a non-monolithic variant.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

###### `--allow-invalid-routing-url`

</td>

<td>

By default, `rover subgraph publish` will fail if an unparsable routing URL is associated with a subgraph. If you need to disable this warning and allow the invalid URL to be published anyway, you can pass this option.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

###### `--no-url`

</td>

<td>

This is shorthand for `--routing-url "" --allow-invalid-routing-url`. **It will override any existing routing URL for the subgraph.**

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Validating subgraph schema changes

### `subgraph check`

<AuthNotice />

Before you [publish subgraph schema changes to GraphOS](#publishing-a-subgraph-schema-to-graphos), you can [check those changes](/graphos/delivery/schema-checks/) to confirm that you aren't introducing breaking changes to your application clients.

To do so, you can run the `subgraph check` command:

```shell
# using a schema file
rover subgraph check my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql --name accounts

# using piped input to stdin
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 \
  | rover subgraph check my-graph@my-variant \
  --schema - --name accounts
```

As shown, arguments and options are similar to [`subgraph publish`](#subgraph-publish).

To configure the behavior of schema checks (such as the time range of past operations to check against), see the [documentation for schema checks](/graphos/delivery/check-configurations/#using-apollo-studio-recommended).

If you don't want to wait for the check to complete, you can run the command with the `--background` flag. You can then look up the check's result in Apollo Studio on the Checks tab.

#### Running checks in CI

If you're running schema checks in CI, you might want to pass the `--background` flag to `rover subgraph check`. This flag instructs Rover to initiate schema checks but _not_ await their result. If you've [connected Apollo Studio to your GitHub repository](/graphos/delivery/github-integration/), the integration detects the checks execution and adds a status to the associated pull request.

### `subgraph lint`

<AuthNotice />

You can run the GraphOS schema linter against your local subgraph schema to identify any violations of formatting and naming best practices:

```bash title="Example command"
rover subgraph lint --name products --schema ./products-schema.graphql my-graph@my-variant
```

The argument `my-graph@my-variant` in the example above is a **graph ref** that specifies the ID of the graph you're comparing your schema changes against, along with which [variant](/graphos/graphs/#variants) you're comparing against.

> Schema linting also runs as one of the checks included in [`subgraph check`](#subgraph-check). Use this command to perform one-off linting.

Options include:

<table class="field-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `--schema`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** The path to a local `.graphql` or `.gql` file, in [SDL format](/resources/graphql-glossary/#schema-definition-language-sdl).

Alternatively, you can provide `-`, in which case the command uses an SDL string piped to `stdin` instead (see [Using `stdin`](../conventions#using-stdin)).

</td>
</tr>

<tr class="required">
<td>

###### `--name`

</td>

<td>

**Required.** The name of the published subgraph to compare schema changes against.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `--ignore-existing-lint-violations`

</td>

<td>

If provided, the linter _only_ flags violations that are present in the diff between your local schema and your published schema.

By default, this command flags _all_ violations in your local schema.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## Deleting a subgraph

### `subgraph delete`

<AuthNotice />

You can delete a single subgraph from a federated variant by running `rover subgraph delete`:

```bash
# ⚠️ This action is irreversible!
rover subgraph delete my-graph@my-variant --name subgraph-to-delete
```

This command prompts you for confirmation because the action is irreversible. You can bypass confirmation by passing the `--confirm` flag.

This command fails with an error if any _other_ subgraph references types that originate in this subgraph.

To delete an entire federated graph instead of a single subgraph, see [Deleting a variant](./graphs/#deleting-a-variant).
