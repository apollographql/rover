# rover client

Commands for working with client operations.

## `rover client extract`

Extract GraphQL documents from supported source files (TypeScript/TSX, Swift, Kotlin) into `.graphql` artifacts.

Example:

```bash
rover client extract --include src/ --include ios/ --include android/ --out-dir graphql/
```

Key flags:

- `--include <PATH>`: files or directories to scan (default: project root)
- `--exclude <PATH>`: skip paths
- `--language <LANG>`: limit to `ts`, `swift`, or `kotlin`
- `--out-dir <DIR>`: where to write `.graphql` files (default `graphql/`)
- `--overwrite`: allow replacing existing `.graphql` files

Notes:

- Only supported extensions are scanned; non-GraphQL source parsing is handled by tree-sitter.
- Interpolated strings are skipped with warnings.
- Stable filenames preserve source-relative paths; conflicts append `.generated` when overwrite is off.

## `rover client check`

Validate operations in `.graphql` files against a graph in GraphOS using the `validateOperations` API.

Example:

```bash
APOLLO_KEY=... rover client check my-graph@current --include graphql/
```

Key flags:

- `GRAPH_REF` positional: required graph ref (e.g., `graph@current`)
- `--include <PATH>`: where to look for `.graphql` files (default: project root)
- `--exclude <PATH>`: skip paths

Behavior:

- Only `.graphql` files are read (no source extraction). Syntax errors cause a non-zero exit.
- Remote `validateOperations` mutation is the source of truth; results are mapped back to file/line/column where possible.
- Outputs support `--format json` with a `client_check` payload containing validation results and failures.
