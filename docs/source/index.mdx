description: Manage, maintain, and compose GraphQL graphs effortlessly with Rover CLI, the command-line interface for Apollo GraphOS.
---

**Rover** is the command-line interface for managing and maintaining graphs with [Apollo GraphOS](/graphos/).

```shell title="Example commands"
# Publish a subgraph schema to GraphOS
$ rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name my-subgraph --schema ./schema.graphql

# Run your supergraph router locally and add multiple subgraphs
$ rover dev

# Fetch a GraphQL server's schema via introspection
$ rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000/graphql

# Compose a federated supergraph schema from multiple subgraphs
$ rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
```

<Note>

Rover doesn't currently provide client-specific features, such as code generation or [client checks](./validating-client-operations). For these features, continue using the [Apollo CLI](/devtools/cli/).
