**Rover** is a CLI for managing and maintaining data graphs with [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/):

```shell:title=Examples
# Publish your graph's schema to Apollo
$ rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

# Fetch your GraphQL server's schema via introspection
$ rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000/graphql

# Compose a federated supergraph schema from multiple subgraphs
$ rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
```

Rover helps you safely publish and fetch GraphQL schemas (both [monolithic](./graphs/) and [federated](./subgraphs/)) from the Apollo schema registry. It is the successor to the Apollo CLI as the primary command-line tool for working with graphs.

  <Button
    size="large"
    color={colors.primary}
    as={<Link to="/getting-started" />}

    Get started with Rover
  </Button>

> Rover does _not_ currently provide client-specific features, such as code generation or client checks. For these features, continue using the [Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/).
