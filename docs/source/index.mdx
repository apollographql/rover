title: The Rover CLI
description: Overview
---

**Rover** is Apollo's command-line interface for managing and maintaining graphs with [GraphOS](/graphos/):

```shell title="Examples"
# Compose multiple GraphQL APIs
$ rover dev

# Publish your graph's schema to Apollo
$ rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

# Fetch your GraphQL server's schema via introspection
$ rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000/graphql

# Compose a federated supergraph schema from multiple subgraphs
$ rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
```

Rover helps you safely publish and fetch GraphQL schemas (both [federated](./commands/subgraphs/) and [monolithic](./commands/graphs/)) from the Apollo schema registry.

> Rover does _not_ currently provide client-specific features, such as code generation or client checks. For these features, continue using the [Apollo CLI](/devtools/cli/).
