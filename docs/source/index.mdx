import { Link } from 'gatsby';

**Rover** is a CLI for managing and maintaining graphs with [Apollo Studio](/studio/):

```shell title="Examples"
# Publish your graph's schema to Apollo
$ rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

# Fetch your GraphQL server's schema via introspection
$ rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000/graphql

# Compose a federated supergraph schema from multiple subgraphs
$ rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
```

Rover helps you safely publish and fetch GraphQL schemas (both [monolithic](./graphs/) and [federated](./subgraphs/)) from the Apollo schema registry. It is the successor to the Apollo CLI as the primary command-line tool for working with graphs.
