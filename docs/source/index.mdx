> **Rover is in active, rapid development.** It should not be used in production projects. Rover commands are subject to breaking changes without notice.

Rover is a CLI for managing and maintaining data graphs with [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/). Upon full release, Rover will replace the existing [Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/) as the primary command-line tool for communicating with Studio.

Rover does _not_ currently provide client-specific features, such as code generation or client checks. For these features, continue using the [Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/).
