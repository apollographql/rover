## Agent rules

- Favor using `rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph.yaml --router-config router.yaml --mcp .apollo/mcp.local.yaml` when being asked to run things locally
- If available, always execute the Connectors Architect tool when being asked to create a Connector or make any changes to an existing one.
- Always use `rover subgraph publish --help` to push any schema changes to GraphOS
