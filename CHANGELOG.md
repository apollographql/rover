# [0.13.0] - 2023-03-10

## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic templates - @dbanty, #1388**

  Rover now fetches templates from a GraphQL API. New templates can be contributed to [the templates repo](https://github.com/apollographql/templates) and will not require a new release of Rover to be used. To see the latest templates, run `rover template list`.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fixes behavior of `--router-config` in `rover dev` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1536 fixes #1535**

  Older versions of Rover did not respect the `supergraph` section of the `--router-config` file. This has been fixed in v0.13.0.

# [0.12.2] - 2023-02-23

## üöÄ Features

- **Warn when `federation_version` is not pinned - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1524**

  As of this release, we no longer recommend auto-updates for the `rover supergraph compose` command because of the coordination path that is required to roll out new versions of Federation. If you do not specify an exact `federation_version`, a warning will be printed. In a future version of Rover we will entirely deprecate auto-updating, so please migrate now. This change includes some changes to our documentation as well, check out [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/supergraphs/#setting-a-composition-version) for more information.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fixes composition error reporting in `rover subgraph check` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1525**

  In Rover v0.12.0 and v0.12.1, running a `rover subgraph check` with an invalid schema failed to report the composition errors, this behavior is fixed in v0.12.2.

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Updates internal node dependencies - @EverlastingBugstoppe**

  `node` v18.14.0 -> v18.14.1
  `npm` v9.4.2 -> v9.5.0

# [0.12.1] - 2023-02-17

## üêõ Fixes

- **Updates the output of a skipped operation check to match regular checks - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1519**

  A bit of polish to the output of the feature just released in 0.12.0.

# [0.12.0] - 2023-02-17

## üöÄ Features

- **Allow `rover subgraph check` to execute without operation check results - @jsegaran, #1490**

  Apollo Studio now allows you to disable operation checks for a graph variant. Older versions of Rover will fail to parse the result of a check without a result for an operation check and return an error. Running the same check in versions of Rover after 0.12.0 will succeed when operation checks are disabled.

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Fix up xtask test runner - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1505**

  `cargo xtask test` detects failed tests and reruns them with some arguments. Unfortunately the code to insert `--target` arguments was in the wrong order and resulted in confusing internal error messages on failed tests, this is now fixed.

## üìö Documentation

- **Adds Gitlab CI/CD Instructions - @ugurcemozturk, #1513 fixes #429**

# [0.11.1] - 2023-02-08

## üêõ Fixes

- **Updates router config in `rover dev` to match newer versions - @dbanty, #1500**

  The default configuration for the router in `rover dev` disables the health check. The router configuration recently renamed this check from `health-check` to `health_check`, which is now reflected in `rover dev`'s default router configuration.

# [0.11.0] - 2023-01-24

## üöÄ Features

- **Manage contract configuration - @sachindshinde, #1475 fixes #1421**
 
  Rover now includes two commands for creating, modifying, and reading contracts: `rover contract publish` and `rover contract describe`. Further documentation can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/contracts).

- **Easier file output with new `--output` argument - @gocamille, #1413 fixes #1212**

  This change adds the new option, `--format`, to allow users to define the format type for messages printed to `stdout` (either by passing `plain` or `json` as an argument to `--format`). This replaces the use of `--output` for defining format types. The `--output` option will be available to define the output file type instead, following [Command Line Interface Guidelines for file outputs](https://clig.dev/#:~:text=%2Do%2C%20%2D%2Doutput%3A%20Output%20file.%20For%20example%2C%20sort%2C%20gcc.). This is an additive, non-breaking change and using the `--output` option will continue to be valid. Further documentation can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/conventions#output-to-a-file).

- **Adds `--router-config` to `rover dev` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1446 fixes #1373, #1345, and #1468**

  The new `--router-config` argument for `rover dev` allows you to pass a [router configuration file]() on startup that can configure settings such as header propagaion and CORS policies. Further documentation can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/dev/#advanced-configuration).

- **Auto-update router versions in `rover dev` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1432**

  `rover dev` will automatically use the version of the router specified in [this plugin file](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/blob/main/latest_plugin_versions.json) instead of a hard coded version.

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Better error and help text for ELv2 license argument - @DoumanAsh, #1456 fixes #1455**

  The help text for the `--elv2-license` argument now includes the expected value for the argument, in addition to the error message returned when the argument is needed but not passed.

- **Updates the Ariadne template URL - @patrick91, #1439**

- **Updates `./examples/supergraph-demo` to `@apollo/server` v4, and removes `./examples/dev` - @EverlastingBugsttopper, #1442 fixes #1440 and #1441**

- **Updates dependencies - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1481, #1450**

  `apollo-parser` 0.3 -> 0.4
  `base64` 0.13 -> 0.21
  `git2` 0.15 -> 0.16
  `graphql_client` 0.11.0 -> 0.12
  `serial_test` 0.9 -> 1.0
  `os_info` 3.4 -> 3.5
  `os_type` 2.4 -> 2.6
  `termcolor` 1.1 -> 1.2
  `tokio` 1.21 -> 1.24

## üìö Documentation

- **Fixes a link to schema check example - @MayCXC, #1431**

# [0.10.0] - 2022-11-10

> Important: 1 potentially breaking change below, indicated by **‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó**

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Fix implementation of `--header` argument - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1369 fixes #1365**

  This change tightens up usage of the `--header` argument used for `introspect` commands by disallowing previously valid (but undocumented) usage like this: `--header "Header-1: value" "Header-2: value"`. After this change, you _must_ conform to what we have in the documentation, which indicates separate instances of the `--header` argument for each header, like so: `--header "Header-1: value" --header "Header-2: value"`.

## üöÄ Features

- **Provide prebuilt binaries for ARM devices - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1356 fixes #582**

  As of this release, [`rover.apollo.dev`](https://rover.apollo.dev) delivers prebuilt binaries from our GitHub release for ARM devices. Most notably this means that Docker on M1 devices should work out of the box. You should be able to replace any custom builds in your tooling pipeline with a call to the [official curl installer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/#linux--macos-installer).

- **Report downstream check task results - @sachindshinde, #1385**

  When running `rover subgraph check` commands, if the proposed schema would cause downstream failures (i.e. with contracts), those failures are now reported in the check response.

- **Faster `rover supergraph compose` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1392 fixes #992**

  Rover now resolves all subgraph schemas in parallel when running `rover supergraph compose` on a `supergraph.yaml` file. This should improve the speed to compose large supergraphs significantly. This change also drastically improves error handling by reporting _all_ issues with resolving subgraph schemas (and informing you which schema(s) failed to resolve) rather than exiting on the first failed schema resolution.

- **Add `--polling-interval` to `rover dev` - @patrick91, #1377 fixes #1221**

  You can now set `--polling-interval` when running `rover dev` to change the frequency of introspection poll requests for subgraphs that don't provide the schema from the file system with the `--schema` argument.

- **Adds `--skip-update-check` to skip the once-per-day update check - @tsing, #1396 fixes #1394**

  Once per day, Rover checks if there is a new version available for update and notifies the user if there is. There is now a flag you can pass to disable this check: `--skip-update-check`. 

- **Respect the `NO_COLOR` environment variable - @chnn, #1360**

  `rover` will not use color in any output when executed with the `NO_COLOR` environment variable set to `true`.

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Updates from clap v3 to clap v4 - @EverlatingBugstopper, #1404 fixes #1400**

  This release updated the command line argument parsing library to major version 4. There should be no noticeable compatibility issues with this update, only lighter binaries. The look and feel of the main `rover --help` output has changed to a neutral color palette along with this change.

- **Updates Rust to 1.65.0 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1399**

- **Updates node.js to v18 - @renovate, #1389**

- **Updates node dev-dependencies - @renovate, #1204 and zs#1398**

- **Remove dependency on the `saucer` crate - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1402**

- **Updates `introspector-gadget` to 0.2.0 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1386**

- **Only cache dependencies in CI, not whole `/target` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1387**

- **Use `engine@main` instead of `engine@current` to fetch the API schema - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1368**

- **Use `lychee` as a link checker instead of npm - @ptondereau, #1328 fixes #1306**

  We now use a Rust-based link checker to check the links in the Rover repository instead of a node-based link checker (that was much more flaky).

- **Describe latest federation versions in `./latest_plugin_versions.json` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1363**

  When you run `rover supergraph compose`, the latest version of composition is automatically downloaded to your machine, these latest version numbers are now stored in `./latest_plugin_versions.json` in the Rover repo.

- **Rename `apollo-` headers to `apollographql-` headers - @jsegaran, #1411**

- **Update npm to v9 - @renovate, #1412**

## üìö Documentation

- **Update studio algolia key to graphos - @trevorblades, #1384**

- **Fix some broken links - @StephenBarlow, #1376**

- **Fix a typo in the migration guide instructing the use of `check` instead of `publish` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1364 fixes #1361**

# [0.9.1] - 2022-09-30

## üöÄ Features

- **Add templates for TypeScript, Go, Kotlin, and Java - @dbanty, #1347**

  The `rover template` commands now include four more languages.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Properly report errors when the first `rover dev` process starts up - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1342**

  If something went wrong while starting the first `rover dev` process, it would attempt to start an attached process, which would fail with an inscrutable `the main rover dev session is no longer active` error message. Now, Rover properly reports issues with starting up the first `rover dev` session.

- **Properly report plugin installation errors on `rover dev` startup - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1357**
  
  If a plugin failed to install when starting `rover dev`, the error wouldn't be reported properly. Now, if something goes wrong, the error message will be printed properly.

- **Replace some misleading error suggestions regarding ports with `rover dev` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1340**

  Some errors suggested retrying the `rover dev` command with a different `--port` argument, which doesn't exist. In these cases, `rover dev` will suggest that you specify a different `--supergraph-port` argument instead.

- **Don't exclude certain git remotes from `GitContext` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1350 fixes #1349**

  In v0.8.2, we started normalizing git remotes for anonymized telemetry. Unfortunately we started excluding git remotes that were not one of BitBucket, GitLab, or GitHub. We now record all of these properly.

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Fix typo in `rover subgraph publish` output - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1358 fixes #1337**

  Instead of saying "Monitor your schema delivery progresson studio", `rover subgraph publish` outputs "You can monitor this launch in Apollo Studio".

- **Improve caching in CI - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1351 and #1352**

  In CI builds, we now cache `/target` _and_ `~/.cargo`, instead of just `/target`. 

- **Specify all dependencies in root `Cargo.toml` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1344**

  All of Rover's dependencies can now be viewed and updated in the root `Cargo.toml`, rather than needing to hunt around the workspace to update crates.

- **Updates dependencies - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1346**

  - assert_cmd 1 -> 2
  - git2 0.14 -> 0.15
  - online 3.0.1 -> 4.0.0

# [0.9.0] - 2022-09-22

## üöÄ Features

- **`rover template` command suite - @dbanty, @michael-watson, @EverlastingBugstopper, #1287**

  Two new commands have made their way to Rover: `rover template list` and `rover template use`. These commands provide a similar experience to `create-react-app`, and allow you to extract GraphQL project templates to your local machine. Check out [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/template/) for more on this new functionality.

- **`rover dev` to facilitate developing a supergraph on your local machine - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1190**

  `rover dev` allows you to join multiple running subgraph servers together into a local supergraph, providing the ability to run queries and inspect query plans with Apollo Sandbox. Check out [the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/dev) for more on this new functionality.

- **If E013 is thrown and `$APOLLO_KEY` is set, give a more helpful suggestion - @ptondereau, #1284, #1285**

  If Studio fails to recognize an API key and `APOLLO_KEY` is set, recommend unsetting the environment variable to use `--profile default` instead.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Remove useless stdout line for composition results - @ptondereau, #1124, #1291**

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Link directly to API Keys page in Studio - @abernix, #1202**

  The `rover config auth` command will now provide a link that takes you directly to the "API Keys" page where you can create a Personal API Key, rather than a page that requires you to click through to another page.

- **Prefer "supergraph schema" terminology to "gateway" - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1239, #1332**

  `rover subgraph publish` now refers to updating the "supergraph schema" as opposed to updating the "gateway," since supergraph schema consumers can be routers and/or gateways now.

## üìö Documentation

- **Fix a few typos in `ARCHITECTURE.md` - @dbanty, #1289**

# [0.8.2] - 2022-09-06

## üöÄ Features

- **Check commands exit with failure when downstream tasks fail - @sachindshinde, #1280**

  Historically, `rover graph check` and `rover subgraph check` have aggregated errors for operation checks and/or composition checks. Checks are expanding in Studio and will continue to expand over time, starting with downstream contract checks for `rover subgraph check`. When these tasks fail, Rover will throw an error and link to the checks page in Studio which will contiain more information on the exact failure.

- **Detect improper VS Code API key pastes on Windows - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1026, 1268**

  We have added new error messages and recovery suggestions for malformed API keys caused by invalid copy+pastes in VS Code on Windows.

- **Adds `--watch` to `introspect` commands - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1207**

  If you pass the `--watch` flag to `rover graph introspect` or `rover subgraph introspect`, the GraphQL server will be introspected once every second, printing updates to the terminal as the introspection response changes. This could be used to bootstrap development workflows when combined with `--output json` and a tool like `jq`.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Trim double quotes in multilingual descriptions - @lrlna, #1245 fixes #1244 and #1114**

  `rover graph introspect` no longer crashes if a field description contains cyrillic symbols.

- **Fix link to ELv2 license information - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1262 fixes #1261**

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Link directly to API Keys page in Studio - @abernix, #1202**

  The `rover config auth` command will now provide a link that takes you directly to the "API Keys" page where you can create a Personal API Key, rather than a page that requires you to click through to another page.

- **Skip Apollo Studio integration tests for fork PRs - @EverlastingBugstopper, #Issue #, 1216**

  Our CI pipeline skips Apollo Studio integration tests for forked repositories because they don't have access to the Apollo Studio organization that we use to run them.

- **Updates MacOS CI pipeline to use xcode 13.4 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1211**

- **Normalize git remote URLs for anonymized telemetry - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1279**

# [0.8.1] - 2022-07-28

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fixes superfluous output in npm installer - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1200 fixes #1197 and #1198**

  In 0.8.0, we released a fix for our npm installer that makes it compatible with yarn workspaces by reinstalling Rover if it doesn't exist. Unfortunately, that means that steps that rely on printing to stdout contained information about the installs in those invocations. This has been fixed.

## üìö Documentation

- **Adds documentation for the async checks feature introduced in 0.8.1 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1193**

# [0.8.0] - 2022-07-27

## üöÄ Features

- **Add new commands to use asynchronous checks API - @Y-Guo, #1139**

  If you want to kick off a check without waiting for it to complete you can provide the `--background` flag to `rover graph check` or `rover subgraph check`. This will start the check in Apollo Studio. If your GitHub repo integrates with the Apollo Studio GitHub App, the check status will be updated on your GitHub branch. Using this flag can save you time and money with your CI provider. 

- **Improved error messages and logs for filesysten read/write - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1183**

  Start using the `saucer` create for file system read/writes. This will provide better errors than the ones provided by `std::fs` e.g. `permission denied os error (2)` by providing context about which file rover is trying to read/write to. Every read/write/other filesystem operation will now be included in the `--log info` output.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Install rover before run if missing in npm package - @trevor-schneer, #1184 fixes #1178**

- **Don't retry `400 Bad Request` errors - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1166**

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Refactor command line argument parsing - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1155**

- **Improve schema downloading for codegen, when building rover - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1166**

- **Update rover to clap v3 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1170 fixes #1165**

- **Add Apollo Studio integration tests - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1188**

  We now run integration tests against Apollo Studio's platform API as part of our release pipeline.

## üìö Documentation

- **Update help message for `rover subgraph introspect` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1169**

  Previously the help message for `rover subgraph introspect` claimed to introspect from Apollo Studio Registry but it really introspects from a running subgraph endpoint.

- **Add Jenkins CI/CD Documentation - @StephenBarlow, #1151**

- **Update, restructure, and add missing docs for existing rover commands - @StephenBarlow, #1154, #1157**

- **Update rover version in CI/CD docs - @rajington, #1177**

- **Fix broken anchors for fetching schema - @tchupp, #1176**

# [0.7.0] - 2022-06-09

## üöÄ Features

- **Adds `readme fetch` and `readme publish` - @cy, #1128, #1141**

  Adds support for fetching and publishing Apollo Studio graph variant READMEs with `rover readme publish` and `rover readme fetch` commands. Usage for these commands can be found by running `rover readme --help` and documentation can be found [on our docs site](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/readmes). 

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fix the endpoint `rover-client` uses to fetch Apollo Studio's GraphQL schema- @EverlastingBugstopper, 1126**

  As of v0.6.0, Rover sends all Apollo Studio requests to the new public platform API. When this change was introduced, we changed where we issued our GraphQL requests, but did not update the build step that fetches the schema which could lead to mismatched types. This is now fixed, fields in the public platform API match codegen. 

- **Fix typo in the environment variable `rover-client` uses to fetch Apollo Studio's GraphQL schema - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1125**
  `s/APOLLO_GPAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL/APOLLO_GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL`

## üìö Documentation

- **Schema checks are now free - @StephenBarlow, #1131**

  Update the documentation to remove references to schema checks being a paid feature, since [they are now free](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/platform/schema-checks-and-launches-are-now-available-for-free-in-apollo-studio/)!

- **Update ARCHITECTURE.md - @cy #1129**

  Update and clarify a few points in ARCHITECTURE.md.

# [0.6.0] - 2022-05-03

> Important: 1 breaking change below, indicated by **‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó**

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Use Apollo's Platform API - @pcarrier, #1074**

  Rover now uses Apollo's Platform API instead of the old Studio API. The breaking change is that the hostname is now `api.apollographql.com` where it used to be `graphql.api.apollographql.com`, you may need to update your firewall rules. Other behavior should remain unchanged.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fixes Input Value Definition block string encoding for descriptions.  - @lrlna, #1116 fixes #1088**

  Input values are now multilined when a description is present to allow for a more readable generated SDL.

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Removes upper bound on Node engines for npm installer - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1120 fixes #1119**

  Previously, Rover required that your node engine was between v14 and v17. We have removed the upper bound on this limit so you can now use Node 18 and any future versions.

- **Adds `cargo xtask docs` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1118**

  Developers of the Rover project can now run `cargo xtask docs` to spin up a local netlify server with your local docset. After running the command, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/rover in your browser and changes you make to ./docs/source/**.md files will be updated automatically on save.

- **Updates dependencies - @renovate-bot, #1117**

  `node` 16.14.2 -> 16.15.0
  `npm` 8.7.0 -> 8.8.0
  `os_info` 3.2 -> 3.3

- **Removes unused dependencies - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1113**

- **Separate Studio client code from generalized GraphQL client code - @Geal, #1061**

  Introduces the `launchpad` workspace crate which contains operations not specific to Apollo Studio such as:

  - launching GraphQL queries using reqwest
  - running an introspection query on a graph
  - transforming a JSON SDL to a schema

# [0.5.4] - 2022-04-26

## üêõ Fixes

- **_Really_ fixes v0.5.2/v0.5.3 broken npm installs - @EverlastingBugstopper**

  It turns out that it's hard to test changes to npm installers without actually publishing to npm. In order to save burning another patch version I release v0.5.4-rc.0 to ensure that my changes would actually fix things.

# [0.5.3] - 2022-04-26

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fixes v0.5.2 broken npm installs - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1108**

# [0.5.2] - 2022-04-26

## üöÄ Features

- **Default `rover supergraph compose` to Federation 2 if a `@link` directive is found in a subgraph schema - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1097 fixes #1090**

  When running `rover supergraph compose`, if `supergraph.yaml` refers to a subgraph that contains an `@link` directive and you haven't set the `federation_version` key, then Rover will use Federation 2 composition by default.

- **Output Federation version information when running `rover supergraph compose` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1102**

  When running `rover supergraph compose`, Rover will print the Federation version number that it is using. You can access this version string programatically by running the command with the `--output json` argument and accessing the `federation_version` field.

- **Accept `-` as valid `supergraph.yaml` to read config from stdin - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1092 fixes #525**

  You can now run commands like `cat supergraph.yaml | rover supergraph compose --config -` much like you've always been able to do with the `--schema` argument in other Rover commands.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Hides `rover-fed2` from `rover --help` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1091 fixes #1085**

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Address Rust 1.60.0 lints - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1098**

- **Updates `binary-install` to v1.0.0 for the npm installer - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1099**

## üìö Documentation

- **Fixes some broken Federation 2 links - @StephenBarlow, #1084**

- **Documents dynamic composition versions - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1087**

# [0.5.1] - 2022-04-11

## üêõ Fixes

- **Return a hard error in CI when the ELv2 license is not accepted instead of hanging for eternity - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1082 fixes #1081**

  If you ran `rover supergraph compose` with `federation_version: 2` in CI - it would prompt you to accept the ELv2 license and hang waiting for the input for eternity. This is no longer the case and you will get a helpful error message detailing exactly what you need to do to never see the error again. For more details on the license, see our [FAQ](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/elastic-license-v2-faq/).

- **Removes extraneous debug statement - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1079**

  In my rush this morning I missed the removal of an `eprintln` statement. It's gone now.

# [0.5.0] - 2022-04-11

> Important: X breaking changes below, indicated by **‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó**

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **`rover-fed2` has been deprecated - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1058**

  `rover fed2 supergraph compose` has been deprecated. You should instead set `federation_version: 2` in your `supergraph.yaml` to use Federation 2 with the `rover supergraph compose` command.

## üöÄ Features

- **`rover supergraph compose` optionally updates automatically - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1058 fixes #2046**

  When running `rover supergraph compose`, Rover will automatically download the correct version of composition to use. In your `supergraph.yaml` files, you can specify `federation_version: 1` or `federation_version: 2` to always get the latest updates. You can pass the `--skip-update` flag to skip checking for an update. You can also specify an exact version if you'd like to pin your federation version, like so: `federation_version: =2.0.0`.

  Additionally, you can run `rover install --plugin supergraph@latest-2` or `rover install --plugin supergraph@v2.0.0` to install a plugin ahead of time, which may be helpful in CI. For Federation 2, you'll have to accept the ELv2 license one time per machine. You likely want to set `APOLLO_ELV2_LICENSE=accept` in CI if you are using Federation 2.

- **Adds `--insecure-unmask-key` to `rover config whoami` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1043 fixes #1023**

  Previously, running `rover config whoami` would output your entire API key to the terminal. This is not the documented behavior, and it is insecure because someone could be sharing their screen while trying to debug and accidentally leak their API key.

  Now, `rover config whoami` will mask your API key when it prints to the terminal. You can override this behavior by passing the `--insecure-unmask-key` flag.

- **Retry on timeouts and connection errors - @ptondereau, #1014 fixes #790**

  Rover will now automatically retry HTTP requests that fail due to timeouts or initial connection errors.

- **Define an HTTP agent for non-studio requests - @ptondereau, #1075 fixes #961**

  Rover now sends a User-Agent header along with all requests, not just requests to Apollo Studio.

- **Adds support for HTTP(S) proxies in npm installer - @farawaysouthwest, #1067 fixes #899**

  You can now install Rover from npm if you are behind a proxy.

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **`rover-fed2` has been deprecated - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1058**

  `rover fed2 supergraph compose` has been deprecated. You should instead set `federation_version: 2` in your `supergraph.yaml` to use Federation 2 with the `rover supergraph compose` command.

## üöÄ Features

- **`rover supergraph compose` optionally updates automatically - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1058 fixes #2046**

  When running `rover supergraph compose`, Rover will automatically download the correct version of composition to use. When you first install Rover, it will automatically download the latest composition function for Federation 1 and Federation 2. In your `supergraph.yaml` files, you can specify `federation_version: 1` or `federation_version: 2` to always get the latest updates. You can pass the `--skip-update` flag to skip checking for an update. You can also specify an exact version if you'd like to pin your composition function, like so: `federation_version: =2.0.0-preview.9`.

  Additionally, you can run `rover install --plugin supergraph@latest-2` or `rover install --plugin supergraph@v2.0.0-preview.9` to install a plugin ahead of time, which may be helpful in CI.

# [0.4.8] - 2022-03-15

## üêõ Fixes

- **Properly pin harmonizer versions - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1039**

  0.4.7 accidentally released harmonizer@v2.0.0-preview.4-1 instead of preview.7 because of semver. Versions are now pinned properly.

# [0.4.7] - 2022-03-15

## üêõ Maintenance

- **Bumps harmonizer to v2.0.0-preview.7 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1037**

  `rover fed2 supergraph compose` now uses rust: `harmonizer@v2.0.0-preview.7` and js: `@apollo/composition@v2.0.0-preview.7`.

# [0.4.6] - 2022-03-14

## üêõ Maintenance

  `rover fed2 supergraph compose` now uses rust: `harmonizer@v2.0.0-preview.5` and js: `@apollo/composition@v2.0.0-preview.5`.

# [0.4.5] - 2022-03-11

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fixes "output from `rover-fed2` was malformed" serialization errors - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1030**

  Federation 2 was broken in 0.4.4, every `rover fed2 supergraph compose` command would return "output from `rover-fed2` was malformed" which was not helpful.

  `rover fed2 supergraph compose` now uses `harmonizer@v2.0.0-preview.4-1`/`@apollo/composition@v2.0.0-preview.4` under the hood and the data passed between rover and rover-fed2 is matched up properly. Happy federating!

# [0.4.4] - 2022-03-09

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Updates the version of the underlying composition packages - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1025**

  `rover supergraph compose` now uses `harmonizer@v0.35.3`/`@apollo/federation@v0.35.4` and `rover fed2 supergraph compose` now uses `harmonizer@v2.0.0-preview.2`/`@apollo/composition@v2.0.0-preview.2`.

- **Updates README badges - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1016**

  Replaced the `stability: experimental` badge with a badge showing Rover's total download count, and replaced the outdated GitHub workflow badge with the appropriate CircleCI badge.

# [0.4.3] - 2022-02-14

## üêõ Fixes

- **Fix npm installer logic for detecting glibc compatibility - @EverlastingBugstopper, #1006 fixes #1004**

  Our npm installer had a dependency that updated to v2.0 which included some breaking changes. These changes made our npm installer always return false when checking if the operating system has an appropriate version of `glibc` installed (in order to download the version of Rover with `supergraph compose` functionality). We have now moved to the appropriate API and installs of v0.4.3 should work as expected.

# [0.4.2] - 2022-02-11

## üöÄ Features

- **Adds launch URL feedback to `rover subgraph publish` - @Y-Guo, #989**

  If a `rover subgraph publish` invocation kicks off a [launch](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/launches/), it will now output the URL associated with the launch so you can go right to it in Studio.

- **Improve messaging for `rover subgraph check` - @david-castaneda, #980**

  In the case where the API schema does not change after a `subgraph check` but the core schema was modified, you are now notified as such rather than being displayed a confusing "there were no changes detected" message.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Omit Float scalars from introspection result - @lrlna, #988 fixes #985**

  Since `Float` is a built-in GraphQL scalar type, it is no longer included in Rover's introspection results.

- **Fix configuration error messages when there are no profiles - @EverlastingBugstopper, #995 fixes #783**

  Rover had a hard time detecting when there were no configured profiles, so it never actually emitted error `E020`. Now it does, and we also get some performance improvements by only parsing environment variables on startup rather than on every time they are needed.

- **No longer panic when printing large output - @EverlastingBugstopper, #955 fixes #842**

  Migrate away from the `println` and `eprintln` macros that can cause panics from time to time and instead use calm_io to gracefully handle output.

- **Lowers the maximum required `glibc` version from 2.18 to 2.17 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #990 fixes #991**

  We build Rover in Docker with the `centos:7` base image, which has `glibc` `v2.17` installed. This means we can lower our installer requirements to 2.17, allowing folks on older machines like centos to install Rover. Thanks to @theJC for the report and help with testing!

- **Removes unused `--profile` argument from `rover subgraph introspect` - @EverlastingBugstopper, #950 fixes #948**

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Use `apollo-encoder` in `rover-client` - @lrlna, #939**

  `sdl-encoder` has been replaced with the official `apollo-encoder` from the [`apollo-rs`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs) ecosystem.

- **Add PR template - @EverlastingBugstopper, #488**

  Now folks who are kind enough to contribute pull requests to Rover's repository will have a helpful template to fill out.

- **Fix mechanism for building old versions of Rover - @EverlastingBugstopper, #973 fixes #967**

  If a build is executed via `cargo xtask dist --version vx.x.x`, it will now _actually_ download the schema it needs from the GitHub release artifacts page in order to build for the exact types that were built at that tagged version.

- **Allow Rover to be installed alongside Node.js v17 - @EverlastingBugstopper, #999 fixes #993**

- **Run plugin tests and lints in xtask - @EverlastingBugstopper, #977 fixes #909**

- **Adds new unused input type to check mutations - @EverlastingBugstopper, #969 fixes #967**

  Update the inputs to our check mutations to always send `null` for the `excludedOperationNames` field.

# [0.4.0] - 2021-11-02

## üöÄ Features

- **Federation 2 Support - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/887]**

  The alpha version of Federation 2 [has been released](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v2/)!

  In Rover, you can use the Federation 2 composition model by running `rover fed2 supergraph compose --config <supergraph.yaml>` after [installing](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v2/federation-2/moving-to-federation-2/) the `rover-fed2` binary.. You _must_ install `rover-fed2` before you can run `rover fed2 supergraph compose`, and they _must_ be the same version in order to be compatible with each other.

- **Graph lifecycle management - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/722] [pull/861]**

  Rover now supports the `rover graph delete` command, which will delete all subgraphs in a federated variant, or delete the schema for a non-federated variant.

  There is also new documentation on how [`rover graph publish`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/graphs/#publishing-a-schema-to-apollo-studio) and [`rover subgraph publish`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/subgraphs/#publishing-a-subgraph-schema-to-apollo-studio) create new variants.

  Additionally, you no longer need to pass `--convert` to `subgraph publish` when publishing a subgraph to a new variant, though you will still need it when converting a non-federated variant to a federated variant.

- **Fetch the subgraph's `routing_url` from the graph registry if it isn't specified in a `supergraph.yaml` file - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/873]**

  Now, whenever `routing_url` is not specified for a subgraph in `supergraph.yaml` and the source is a `graphref` (which fetches a subgraph from the graph registry), the composed supergraph will use the routing URL from the graph registry for that subgraph instead of an empty string.

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **`rover supergraph compose` uses a newer composition function that is incompatible with older versions of `@apollo/gateway` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/801] [pull/832]**

  The `rover supergraph compose` command produces a supergraph schema by using composition functions from the [`@apollo/federation`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/api/apollo-federation/) package. Because that library is still in pre-1.0 releases (as are Rover and Apollo Gateway), this update to Rover means `rover supergraph compose` will create a supergraph schema with new functionality. In turn, this requires that you update your `@apollo/gateway` version to >= v0.39.x.

## üöÄ Features

- **Adds options to bypass TLS validation - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/720] [pull/837]**

  In some configurations, often on internal networks, you might need Rover to communicate over encrypted channels (e.g., HTTPS) but avoid the more stringent digital certificate verifications that validate hostnames. You might even need to bypass the digital certificate validation entirely. This is generally not recommended and considered to be much less secure but for cases where it's necessary, but now there are two flags you can use to configure how Rover validates HTTPS requests:

  - The `--insecure-accept-invalid-hostnames` flag disables hostname validation. If hostname verification is not used, any valid certificate for any site is trusted for use from any other. This introduces a significant vulnerability to person-in-the-middle attacks.

  - The `--insecure-accept-invalid-certs` flag disables certificate validation. If invalid certificates are trusted, any certificate for any site is trusted for use. This includes expired certificates. This introduces significant vulnerabilities, and should only be used as a last resort.

  [issue/720]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/720

- **Adds option to increase rover's request timeout - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/792] [pull/838]**

  By default, Rover times out requests to the Apollo Studio API and your graph endpoints after 30 seconds. Now, if you're executing a command that might take longer than 30 seconds to process, you can increase this timeout with the `--client-timeout` option like so:

  ```sh
  rover subgraph check my-graph --validation-period 1m --client-timeout=60
  ```

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Simplify error formatting - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/845]**

  Now, Rover always indents the suggestion by 8 spaces instead of determining its length based on the length of the error descriptor, and the underlying cause of request errors will only be printed once.

  Most git remotes include an author and a repo name, but this isn't always the case. One of Rover's dependencies assumed this _was_ always the case, and would panic if it wasn't the case. This broke workflows for people who had these types of git remotes, but it won't anymore!

## üêõ Fixes

- **Update GraphQL types to match new API Schema - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/696] [pull/697]**

  The Apollo Studio API introduced a change that made a field in the `subgraph publish` mutation nullable. This caused our codegen to fail and users started getting some cryptic error messages for failed publishes in older versions of Rover.

  This release handles these cases better and also introduces local tooling for building old versions of Rover with the API schemas that were in production at the time that version was published with `cargo xtask dist --release vx.x.x`.

## üöÄ Features

- **Adds structured output to Rover - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/285] [pull/676]**

  Rover now has an `--output` parameter on every command that allows you to format Rover's output as well-structured JSON. This structure is not set in stone and will change prior to a stable release. If you write scripts around this structured output, then you should add a check in your scripts for the top level `json_version` key, and make sure to update your scripts when that version is not what you expect (the first version is `1.beta`).

  We'd love your feedback on this new feature, or if you notice any bugs in your existing workflows, so please submit issues!

  In certain scenarios, Rover will encounter GraphQL errors, which are return as an array of strings. Previously, we were not checking if that array was empty before attempting to print the first error in the array, which caused Rover to [panic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html). Rover has now been refactored a bit to have simpler GraphQL error handling and will no longer panic in this scenario.

  Once a day, when a new version of Rover is available, it messages users letting them know that they can update. Unfortunately, this message was being printed to `stdout` instead of `stderr` due to a bug in an upstream dependency.

  Version 0.1.3 of Rover attempted to vendor OpenSSL as part of its build process, but MacOS comes preinstalled with LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL. Unfortunately, LibreSSL does not work with Rosetta 2, which allows M1 Mac users to emulate x86_64 code on their machines. Installing and specifying the correct OpenSSL version solves this problem.

## üöÄ Features

- **Prebuilt binaries for Alpine Linux - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/537] [pull/538]**

  Previously, Rover was only built for systems that had [`glibc`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) >= 2.18 installed. This was due to the fact that we embed [v8](https://v8.dev/) into the binaries to execute the JS-powered `rover supergraph compose` command.

  Our CI pipeline now produces a statically-linked binary compiled with [`musl-libc`](https://www.musl-libc.org/) that *does not include* `rover supergraph compose`. Our installers will check if you have a compatible version of `glibc`, and if you do not, it will download the new statically linked binary and warn you that it is missing some functionality.

  We hope to bring `rover supergraph compose` to Alpine in the future, though how soon that future will come is [not yet known](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/546).

- **`--routing-url` is now an optional argument to `rover subgraph publish` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/169] [pull/484]**

  When publishing a subgraph, it is important to include a routing URL for that subgraph, so your graph router
  knows where to route requests for types in a subgraph. Previously, you had to specify this argument on
  every `rover subgraph publish`, but now it acts as an upsert, meaning you must include it on your first
  `rover subgraph publish`, but subsequent publishes will retain the existing routing URL for a subgraph
  if `--routing-url` is not specified.

  Previously, when Rover deserialized a supergraph configuration file, it did so using a HashMap.

- **Remove Rover binary before overwriting it - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/398] [pull/400]**

  Updating Rover with `curl` required a restart on MacOS due to Apple's
  Gatekeeper not recognizing that a new package has been installed on a
  user's system. This forces the installer to remove previously Rover
  directory and its installation and do a fresh installation.

## üöÄ Features
- **Adds introspection ability for subgraphs - [lrlna], [issue/349] [pull/377]**

  A new command, `rover subgraph introspect` has been added. This command
  runs a _federated introspection_ query against a server which has
  implemented the requirements of the [federation
  specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/).
  This command accepts endpoint headers (`-H`, `--header`) for making the introspection
  request (if required) and outputs SDL to stdout.

- **Fallback to monochromic output in installer when `tput` is unavailable - [abernix], [issue/371] [pull/372]**

  The `tput` command allows easier ANSI output using named values in rather than
  control characters.

  While we could just use control characters and maintain colored output in the
  absence of `tput`, it's probably also reasonable to gracefully fall back to
  monochromatic output.

  [issue/371]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/371

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
- **Renames `core build` to `supergraph compose` - [lrlna], [pull/391]**

  To align with other Apollo teams on the usage of `supergraph` and
  `composition`, we are renaming `core build` to `supergraph compose`.

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/391]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/391

- **Updates harmonizer@0.2.2 - [abernix], [pull/396]**

  Updates harmonizer to the latest version. This version now composes and
  returns a core schema instead of CSDL. CSDL was an internal implementation
  of composition and this new format is meant to bring some stability to `rover
  supergraph compose`.

  [abernix]: https://github.com/abernix
  [pull/396]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/396

## üêõ Fixes
- **Handle 400-599 HTTP responses - [lrlna], [issue/394] [issue/187] [pull/395]**

  Previously, Rover did not provide errors for any HTTP requests that return a status code between 400 and 599. This fix makes sure Rover checks for those errors before moving on to parsing the response body.

  This fix also does an extra check for 400 errors, as the Apollo
  Server sends additional information that we can display to users.

- **Test, build and release on ubuntu-16.04 - [abernix], [pull/381]**

  This pins us to Ubuntu 16.04 which ships with glib 2.19. This should allow
  us to work with a wider range of operating systems than the newer glib
  that we get with Ubuntu 20.04, which is ubuntu-latest on GitHub Actions
  Virtual Environments (which resulted in a Rover that wouldn't run on
  Ubuntu 18.04).

  Ubuntu 16.04 is LTS until April 2024, and is still receiving active
  updates through the LTS program.

> Important: Two breaking changes below, indicated by **‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó**

## üöÄ Features

- **Core schema building capabilities - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/340]**

  Adds a new command, `rover core build` to handle building 
  [core schema documents](https://specs.apollo.dev/#core-schemas)
  from multiple subgraph schemas. This also adds a new config format to support
  this command in YAML. Currently, this is only documented in [pull/340].

  [EverlastingBugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper
  [pull/340]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/340

- **Adds introspection ability for graphs - [lrlna], [issue/180] [issue/171] [pull/283]**

  A new command, `rover graph introspect` has been added, usable for introspecting
  graphs (not subgraphs). This command accepts endpoint [headers] for making the
  introspection request (if required) and outputs SDL to stdout.

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Rename `push` to `publish` everywhere - [JakeDawkins], [issue/344] [pull/347]**

  "Publish" is a more correct name for what these commands do. We wanted to be
  extra clear about its name matching its functionality, so any usage of `push`
  commands should now be `publish`.

  [pull/347]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/347
  [issue/344]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/issues/344

- **Rename `committer` to `author` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/338] [pull/339]**

  Note: This is only  breaking change if you were previously using the `APOLLO_VCS_COMMITTER` 
  env variable. If so, migrate by changing that environment variable to `APOLLO_VCS_AUTHOR`.

  Changes the underlying git context implementation to report the `author` of a commit rather than a `committer`. This is primarily intended to properly link the real author with a commit in Apollo Studio.

## üêõ Fixes

- **Output composition errors to stderr - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/335]**

  There was an incorrect usage of `tracing::error`, causing composition errors
  to not show up when expected. This change unifies this error printing with the
  rest of the project.

  [EverlastingBugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper
  [pull/335]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/335

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Auto-bump versions in install scripts - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/332]**

  team will miss this important step in the release process.

  [EverlastingBugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper
  [pull/332]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/332

- **Don't print by default for automatic update checks - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/342]**

  When Rover automatically checks for updates every 24 hours, it no longer will
  print if there is no update available. It will still print for manual checks
  and if Rover is out of date.

  [EverlastingBugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper
  [pull/342]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/342

- **Add metadata to `Cargo.toml` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/346]**

## üöÄ Features

- **‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó Squash `config show` functionality into `config whoami` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/274] [pull/323]**

  Since the only thing that `rover config show` did was show the saved api key,
  it made sense to squash that functionality into the `whoami` command. We decided
  that we'd prefer not to ever expose the full api key to stdout (you can still
  find it in the saved config file), but we still show the first and last 4 
  characters of it to help with debugging.

- **`rover docs` commands to make viewing documentation easier - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/308] [pull/314]**

  To make it easier to find and navigate Rover's docs, we added two commands: 
  `rover docs list` to list helpful docs pages and `rover docs open` to open a
  docs page in the browser.

- **Better errors and suggestions for invalid variants - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/208] [pull/316]**

  Previously, Rover would tell you if you tried accessing an invalid variant, 
  but couldn't provide any recommendations. This adds recommendations for simple
  typos, lists available variants for graphs with small numbers of variants, and
  provides a link to view variants in Apollo Studio for graphs with many variants.

- **Remove the need to reload terminal after install - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/212] [pull/318]**
  
  Rather than asking users to reload their terminal after install, we do the
  extra work of sourcing Rover's env file after install, preventing linux users
  from having to do that or reload the terminal themselves.

- **Rover automatically checks for updates - [JakeDawkins], [issue/296] [pull/319]**

  Every 24 hours, Rover will automatically check for new releases and let you know.
  You can also run the `rover update check` command to manually check for updates.
  If an update is available, Rover warns once per day at most and provides a link
  to the docs for update instructions.

- **Update installers to be consistent and not require version variables - [JakeDawkins], [issue/88] [pull/324]**

  This provides a consistent experience when installing Rover. When running the
  linux install script, you no longer are required to pass a `VERSION`, but still
  may if you want to download an older version. The windows installer now supports
  the same `$Env:VERSION` environment variable for similar overrides. By default,
  installer scripts will download the version of rover released with that version
  of the script.

- **Verify paths are all valid utf-8 - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/326]**

  Just to make our code more safe and easier to maintain, we now check and make
  sure paths are all valid utf-8 to make sure any non utf-8 paths won't cause unexpected issues.

- **Move all build-time checks for env variables to util - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/310]**

  Having a bunch of `env!` macros across the codebase is just less beautiful and
  maintainable than having them in one utility file. This PR just moves all of those
  calls, looking up `CARGO_ENV_*` environment variables to a single place.

- **Make output tables prettier - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/315]**

  Replaces the characters in table borders with characters that show fewer &
  smaller gaps to make tables look a little more polished :)

- **Add test to make sure install scripts never change names/paths - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/321]**

  This adds a simple test to make sure we don't move or rename install scripts
  on accident in the future, since that would be a major breaking change.

# [0.0.2] - 2021-02-23

## üöÄ Features

- **Better logging experience - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/263]**

  When passing `--log debug`, the logs are now pretty printed with their call location.

  Additionally, progress messages are no longer printed with an `INFO` prefix on every line,
  messages are displayed to the user with no mess and no fuss.

  [EverlastingBugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper
  [pull/263]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/263

- **Add useful info to debug logs - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/268]**

  When running Rover with `--log debug`, you can now see which environment variables are being used
  and the raw JSON payload returned by the Apollo Studio API.

  [EverlastingBugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper
  [pull/268]: https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/268

- **Provide a better error message for malformed API Keys - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/215] [pull/275]**

  Before, if you passed a malformed API key, the error message was "406: Not Acceptable", since that's
  what the Apollo Studio API returned. Rover now provides you with a
  much more actionable error message.

- **Add support for M1 Macbooks - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/295] [pull/297]/[pull/300]**

  Big Sur allows the new M1 Macbooks to run code compiled for the `x86_64` architecture in emulation
  mode, even though the machines themselves have an `arm64` architecture. We have updated
  our `curl | sh` installer and our `npm` installer to reflect this, and anybody running Big Sur
  on the new M1 machines can now install and use Rover.

- **Add a `> ` prompt to the `rover config auth` command - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/279] [pull/281]**

  It was a bit confusing to be presented with a blank line after running `rover config auth`.
  To make it more clear that this is a prompt for an API key, we now print `> ` at the beginning
  of the prompt.

- **Add a friendlier message for the case of no config profiles - [JakeDawkins], [issue/202] [pull/303]**

  The new user experience, where there are no config profiles found, was a little cryptic.
  To make it easier to understand what the problem is, we added a friendly error message
  asking the user to run `rover config auth`.

- **Output Service title for graph keys in whoami command - [lrlna], [issue/280] [pull/299]**

  `rover config whoami` was displaying `Name` information which was unclear
  in the context of this command. Instead of `Name`, we are now displaying
  `Service title` information for graph keys, and omitting `Name` and
  `Service Title` for user keys, as the already existing information provides
  enough information for `User`.

- **Always use the shorthand ref when generating Git Context - [lrlna], [pull/255]**
