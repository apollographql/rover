## üöÄ Features

- **Better logging experience - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/263]**

  When passing `--log debug`, the logs are now pretty printed with their call location.

  Additionally, progress messages are no longer printed with an `INFO` prefix on every line,
  messages are displayed to the user with no mess and no fuss.

- **Add useful info to debug logs - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/268]**

  When running Rover with `--log debug`, you can now see which environment variables are being used
  and the raw JSON payload returned by the Apollo Studio API.

- **Provide a better error message for malformed API Keys - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/215] [pull/275]**

  Before, if you passed a malformed API key, the error message was "406: Not Acceptable", since that's
  what the Apollo Studio API returned. Rover now provides you with a
  much more actionable error message.

- **Add support for M1 Macbooks - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/295] [pull/297]/[pull/300]**

  Big Sur allows the new M1 Macbooks to run code compiled for the `x86_64` architecture in emulation
  mode, even though the machines themselves have an `arm64` architecture. We have updated
  our `curl | sh` installer and our `npm` installer to reflect this, and anybody running Big Sur
  on the new M1 machines can now install and use Rover.

- **Add a `> ` prompt to the `rover config auth` command - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/279] [pull/281]**

  It was a bit confusing to be presented with a blank line after running `rover config auth`.
  To make it more clear that this is a prompt for an API key, we now print `> ` at the beginning
  of the prompt.

- **Add a friendlier message for the case of no config profiles - [JakeDawkins], [issue/202] [pull/303]**

  The new user experience, where there are no config profiles found, was a little cryptic.
  To make it easier to understand what the problem is, we added a friendly error message
  asking the user to run `rover config auth`.

- ** Output Service title for graph keys in whoami command - [lrlna], [issue/280] [pull/299]**

  `rover config whoami` was displaying `Name` information which was unclear
  in the context of this command. Instead of `Name`, we are now displaying
  `Service title` information for graph keys, and omitting `Name` and
  `Service Title` for user keys, as the already existing information provides
  enough information for `User`.

- **Always use the shorthand ref when generating Git Context - [lrlna], [pull/255]**

  Rover now computes the shorthand ref and specifies that as the "branch", even
  if the specific ref is not necessarily a branch (such as a tag).

- **Fix npx usage documentation - [abernix], [pull/270]**

- **Update layout of Rover's intro article - [StephenBarlow], [pull/259]**

  The intro article in Rover's docs were reordered to put the info about the Public preview
  towards the bottom of the page, so more relevant information is no longer below the fold.
